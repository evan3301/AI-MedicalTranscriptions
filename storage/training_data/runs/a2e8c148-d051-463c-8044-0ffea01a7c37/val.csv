1466,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 61-year-old woman with a history of polyarteritis nodosa, mononeuritis multiplex involving the lower extremities, and severe sleep apnea returns in followup following an overnight sleep study, on CPAP and oxygen to evaluate her for difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep.  She returns today to review results of an inpatient study performed approximately two weeks ago.,In the meantime, the patient reports she continues on substantial doses of opiate medication to control leg pain from mononeuritis multiplex.,She also takes Lasix for lower extremity edema.,The patient reports that she generally initiates sleep on CPAP, but rips her mask off, tosses and turns throughout the night and has ""terrible quality sleep."",MEDICATIONS: , Current medications are as previously noted.  Changes include reduction in prednisone from 9 to 6 mg by mouth every morning.  She continues to take Ativan 1 mg every six hours as needed.  She takes imipramine 425 mg at bedtime.,Her MS Contin dose is 150 mg every 8 to 12 hours and an immediate release morphine preparation, 45 to 75 mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed.,FINDINGS: , Vital signs:  Blood pressure 153/81, pulse 90, respiratory rate 20, weight 311.8 pounds (up 10 pounds from earlier this month), height 5 feet 6 inches, temperature 98.4 degrees, SaO2 is 88% on room air at rest.  Chest is clear.  Extremities show lower extremity pretibial edema with erythema.,LABORATORIES: , An arterial blood gas on room air showed a pH of 7.38, PCO2 of 52, and PO2 of 57.,CPAP compliance monitoring over the past two to three weeks showed average use of 3 hours 26 minutes on nights used.  She used it for greater than 4 hours per night on 67% of night surveyed.  Her estimated apnea/hypopnea index was 3 per hour.  Her average leak flow was 67 liters per minute.,The patient's overnight sleep study was performed as an inpatient sleep study during a routine hospitalization for intravenous gamma globulin therapy.  She slept for a total sleep time of 257 minutes out of 272 minutes in bed (sleep efficiency approximately 90%).  Sleep stage distribution was relatively normal with 2% stage I, 72% stage II, 24% stage III, IV, and 2% stage REM sleep.,There were no periodic limb movements during sleep.,There was evidence of a severe predominantly central sleep apnea during non-REM sleep at 173 episodes per hour and during REM sleep at 77 episodes per hour.  Oxyhemoglobin saturations during non-REM sleep fluctuated from the baseline of 92% to an average low of 82%.  During REM sleep, the baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation was 87% , decreased to 81% with sleep-disordered breathing episodes.,Of note, the sleep study was performed on CPAP at 10.5 cm of H2O with oxygen at 8 liters per minute.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  The patient has evidence of a well-compensated respiratory acidosis, which is probably primarily related to severe obesity.  In addition, there may be contribution from large doses of opiates and standing doses of gabapentin.,2.  Severe central sleep apnea, on CPAP at 10 cmH2O and supplemental oxygen at 8 liters per minute.  The breathing pattern is that of cluster or Biot's breathing throughout sleep.  The primary etiology is probably opiate use, with contribution with further exacerbation by severe obesity which acts to lower the baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation, and worsen desaturations during apneic episodes.,3.  Mononeuritis multiplex with pain requiring significant substantial doses of analgesia.,4.  Hypoxemia primarily due to obesity, hypoventilation, and presumably basilar atelectasis and a combination of V/Q mismatch and shunt on that basis.,PLANS: , My overall impression is that we should treat this patient's sleep disruption with measures to decrease central sleep apnea during sleep.  These will include, (1).  Decrease in evening doses of MS Contin, (2).  Modest weight loss of approximately 10 to 20 pounds, and (3).  Instituting Automated Servo Ventilation via nasal mask.  With regard to latter, the patient will be returning for a trial of ASV to examine its effect on sleep-disordered breathing patterns.,In addition, the patient will benefit from modest diuresis, with improvement of oxygenation, as well as nocturnal desaturation and oxygen requirements.  I have encouraged the patient to increase her dose of Lasix from 100 to 120 mg by mouth every morning as previously prescribed.  I have also asked her to add Lasix in additional late afternoon to evening dose of Lasix at 40 mg by mouth at that time.  She was instructed to take between one and two K-Tab with her evening dose of Lasix (10 to 20 mEq).,In addition, we will obtain a complete set of pulmonary function studies to evaluate this patient for underlying causes of parenchymal lung disease that may interfere with oxygenation.  Further workup for hypoxemia may include high-resolution CT scanning if evidence for significant pulmonary restriction and/or reductions in diffusion capacity is evident on pulmonary function testing.",Sleep Medicine

A Gram stain showed rare white blood cells, many red blood cells, no organisms.,ASSESSMENT: , A 21-day-old with:,1.  Rule out sepsis.,2.  Possible upper respiratory infection.,Given the patient's multiple sick contacts, he is possibly with a viral upper respiratory infection causing his upper airway congestion plus probable fever.  The bacterial considerations although to consider in this child include group B streptococcus, E. coli, and Listeria.  We should also consider herpes simplex virus, although these 3200 red blood cells from his CSF could be due to his bloody tap in the ER.  Also, there is not a predominant lymphocytosis of his CSF sample (there is 0 white blood cell count in the cell count).,Also to consider in this child is RSV.  The patient though has more congested, nasal breathing more than respiratory distress, for example retractions, desaturations, or accessory muscle use.

She had had a previous PD catheter placed, but it became infected and had to be removed.  She, therefore, comes back to the operating room for a new PD catheter.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A small transverse right upper quadrant incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection.  The fascia was divided and the posterior fascia and peritoneum were identified.  A hole was made in the posterior fascia through the peritoneum and into the peritoneal cavity.  The omentum came up through the hole and so therefore the omentum was actually brought up and a small portion of it removed, which could easily be brought up through the incision.  A PD catheter was then placed into the pelvis over a guidewire.  At this point, the peritoneum and posterior fascia was closed around the catheter.  The anterior fascia was then closed over the top of the cuff leaving the cuff buried in the fascia.  The second incision was then made lateral and the catheter brought out through a second incision and the subcutaneous cuff then positioned at that site.  The catheter was then connected and two runs of a 150 mL of fluid were made with a good inflow and a good clear return.  The skin was closed with 5-0 subcuticular Monocryl.  Sterile dressings were applied and the young lady awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.",Nephrology

Debulking of hemangioma of the nasal tip through an open rhinoplasty approach.,2.  Rhinoplasty.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Minimal.,FINDINGS: , Large hemangioma involving the midline of the columella separated the lower lateral cartilages at a level of the columella and the nasal domes.,CONDITION:  ,Condition of the patient at end of the procedure stable, transferred to recovery room.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 2-year-old female with a history of a nasal tip hemangioma.  The hemangioma has involved at her upper tongue.  There has not been any change in the last 6 months.  We have discussed with the parents the situation and decided to proceed with the debulking of the nasal tip hemangioma.  They understand the nature of the incision, the nature of the surgery, and the possibility of future revision surgeries.  They understand the risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, need for future revision surgery, and minor asymmetry.  They wished to proceed with surgery.,Because of the procedure, informed consent is obtained.  The patient is taken to operating room and placed in the supine position.  General anesthetic is administrated to an oroendotracheal tube.  The face is prepped and draped in the usual manner.  The incision is designed to the lower aspect of the hemangioma, which corresponds to the columella and upper lip junction and then the remaining of the incision is designed as an open rhinoplasty with bilateral rim incisions.  The area is infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine.  We waited 7 minutes for the hemostatic effect and proceeded with the incision.  The incision was then done with a 15 C blade starting at the columella and then going laterally to the level of the rim and the double hook is placed at the level of the dome and the intracartilage incision is done through the mucosa, then extended laterally and upward to follow the lower lateral cartilage.  This is done in both sides.  Further incision is done.  A small tenotomy scissors is used and with the help of retraction of the lower lateral cartilage, the hemangioma is separated gently from the lower lateral cartilage on both sides and I proceeded to leave that the central part of the incision lifting up the entire columella to the level of the nasal tip.  The hemangioma is removed and is found to be involving the medial aspects of both medial crura.  This gently separated from the medial crura and from the soft tissue care is taken not to remove the entire hemangioma from the skin as the nose not to devascularize the distal columella portion.  Hemostasis is achieved with electrocautery.  Then, we proceed to place some interdomal stitches with the help of a 6-0 clear nylon and intercrural stitches are placed and then an interdomal stitch, a single one was placed.  The skin is redraped and the nose found to have satisfactory shape.  The columellar piece was tailored on the lateral aspect corresponding to rim incisions to match the newly created width of the columella.  Portions of skin and hemangioma are taken laterally on both sides of the columella distally.  The skin was closed with 6-0 mild chromic stitches, including the portion at the level of the columella and rim incisions medially.  The remaining of the internal incisions are closed with 5-0 chromic interrupted stitches.  The nose is irrigated and suctioned.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  Sponge and instrument count were complete at the end of the procedure.",Cosmetic / Plastic Surgery

Repair of lateral meniscus using two fast fixed meniscal repair sutures.,3.  Partial medial meniscectomy.,4.  Partial chondroplasty of patella.,5.  Lateral retinacular release.,6.  Open medial plication as well of the right knee.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,TOURNIQUET TIME:,  130 minutes at 325 mmHg.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , There was noted to be a grade-II chondromalacia patellofemoral joint.  The patella was noted to be situated laterally past the lateral femoral condyle.  There was a tear to the posterior horn of the medial meniscus within the white zone.  There was a complex tear involving a horizontal cleavage component to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus as well in the entire meniscus.  There was a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament.  The posterior cruciate ligament appeared intact.  Preoperatively, she had a positive Lachman with a positive pivot shift test as well as increased patellofemoral instability.,HISTORY: , This is a 39-year-old female who has sustained a twisting injury to her knee while on trampoline in late August.  She was diagnosed per MRI.  An MRI confirmed the clinical diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament tear.  She states she has had multiple episodes of instability to the patellofemoral joint throughout the years with multiple dislocations.  She elected to proceed with surgery to repair the anterior cruciate ligament as well as possibly plicate the medial retinaculum to help prevent further dislocations of the patellofemoral joint.  All risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with her at length.  She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE:  ,On 09/11/03, she was taken to the operating room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesiology Department.  Tourniquet was placed on the proximal thigh and it was then placed in a knee holder.  She was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  Longitudinal incision was made just medial to the tibial tubercle.  The subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The tendons of gracilis and semitendinosus were identified and isolated, and then stripped off the musculotendinous junction.  They were taken on the back table.  The soft tissue debris was removed from the tendons.  The ends of the tendons were sewn together using #5 Tycron whip type sutures.  The tendons were measured on back table and found to be 8 mm as the most adequate size, they were then placed under tension on the back table.  Stab incision was made in the inferolateral parapatellar region, through this camera was placed in the knee.  The knee was inflated with saline solution and operative pictures were obtained.  The above findings were noted.  A second port site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  Through this, a probe was placed.  Tear in the posterior horn medial meniscus was identified.  It was resected using a meniscal resector.  It was then further contoured using arthroscopic shaver.  Attention was then taken to the lateral compartment.  A partial meniscectomy was performed using the resector and the shaver.  The posterior periphery of the lateral meniscus was also noticed to be unstable.  A repair was then performed using two fasting fixed meniscal repair sutures to help anchor the meniscus around the popliteus tendon.  There was noted to be excellent fixation.  The shaver was then taken into the intrachondral notch.  First a partial chondroplasty was performed on the patella to remove the loose articular debris as well as a partial synovectomy to the medial aspect of the patellar femoral joint.  Next, the remnant of the anterior cruciate ligament was removed using the arthroscopic shaver and arthroplasty was then performed on the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle.  Next, a tibial guide was placed through the anterior medial portal.  A ___ pin was then placed up through the anterior incision entering the tibial eminence just anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament.  This tibial tunnel was then drilled using 8 mm cannulated drill.  Next, an over-the-top guide was then placed at approximately the 11:30 position.  A ____ pin was then placed into the femur and 8 mm drill was then used to drill this femoral tunnel approximately 35 mm.  Next the U shape guide was placed through tibial tunnel into the femur.  A pin was then placed through the distal femur from lateral to medial, through the U-shaped guide a puller wire was then passed through the distal femur.  It was then pulled out through the tibial tunnel using the You-shaped guide.  The tendon was then placed around the wire.  The wire was pulled back up through the tibial into the femoral tunnel.  A 40 mm bioabsorbable pin was then placed through the femoral tunnel securing the hamstring tendons.  Attention was then pulled through the tibial tunnel.  The knee was cycled approximately 20 times.  A 9 mm bioabsorbable screw was then placed through the tibial tunnel fixating the distal aspect of the graft.  There was noted definite fixation of the graft.  There was no evidence of impingement either in full flexion or full extension.  The knee was copiously irrigated and it was then suctioned dry.  A longitudinal incision was made just medial to the patellofemoral joint.  Soft tissues were carefully dissected and the medial retinaculum was incised along with the incision.  Following this, a release of lateral retinaculum was performed using a knife to further release the patellofemoral joint and allow further medial plication.  The medial retinaculum was then plicated using #1 Ethibond sutures and then oversewn with #0 Vicryl suture.  The subcuticular tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures followed by a #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch.  She was placed in a DonJoy knee immobilizer.  The tourniquet was deflated.  It was noted the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill.  She was transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded.  She will be full weightbearing on the lower extremity using the knee immobilizer locked in extension.  She may remove her dressing two to three days, however, follow back in the office in 10 to 14 days for suture removal.  She will require one to two more physical therapy to help regain motion and strength to the lower extremity.",Orthopedic

He has made multiple visits in the past. Today, the patient presents himself in severe respiratory distress. His wife states that since his recent admission of three weeks ago for treatment of pneumonia, he has not seemed to be able to recuperate, and has persistent complaints of shortness of breath.,Today, his symptoms worsened and she brought him to the emergency room. To the best of her knowledge, there has been no fever. He has persistent chronic cough, as always.

No white cells and 0-2 red cells.,Chest x-ray suboptimal in quality, but without obvious infiltrates, consolidation or pneumothorax.,CRITICAL CARE NOTE:,  Critical care one hour.,Shortly after the patient’s initial assessment, the patient apparently began to complain of chest pain and appeared to the nurse to have mounting exhaustion and respiratory distress. Although O2 had been placed, elevating his oxygen saturations to the mid to upper 90s, he continued to complain of symptoms, as noted above. He became progressively more rapidly obtunded. The patient did receive one gram of magnesium sulfate shortly after his arrival, and the BiPAP apparatus was being readied for his use. However, the patient, at this point, became unresponsive, unable to answer questions, and preparations were begun for intubation. The BiPAP apparatus was briefly placed while supplies and medications were assembled for intubation. It was noted that even with the BiPAP apparatus, in the duration of time which was required for transfer of oxygen tubing to the BiPAP mask, the patient’s O2 saturations rapidly dropped to the upper 60 range.,All preparations for intubation having been undertaken, Succinylcholine was ordered, but was apparently unavailable in the department. As the patient was quite obtunded, and while the Dacuronium was being sought, an initial trial of intubation was carried out using a straight blade and a cupped 7.9 endotracheal tube. However, the patient had enough residual muscle tension to make this impractical and further efforts were held pending administration of Dacuronium 10 mg. After approximately two minutes, another attempt at intubation was successful. The cords were noted to be covered with purulent exudates at the time of intubation.,The endotracheal tube, having been placed atraumatically, the patient was initially then nebulated on 100% oxygen, and his O2 saturations rapidly rose to the 90-100% range.,Chest x-ray demonstrated proper placement of the tube. The patient was given 1 mg of Versed, with decrease of his pulse from the 140-180 range to the 120 range, with satisfactory maintenance of his blood pressure.,Because of a complaint of chest pain, which I myself did not hear, during the patient’s initial triage elevation, a trial of Tridil was begun. As the patient’s pressures held in the slightly elevated range, it was possible to push this to 30 mcg per minute. However, after administration of the Dacuronium and Versed, the patient’s blood pressure fell somewhat, and this medication was discontinued when the systolic pressure briefly reached 98.,Because of concern regarding pneumonia or sepsis, the patient received one gram of Rocephin intravenously shortly after the intubation. A nasogastric and Foley were placed, and an arterial blood gas was drawn by respiratory therapy. Dr. X was contacted at this point regarding further orders as the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit to be placed on the ventilator there. The doctor’s call was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit so he could leave appropriate orders for the patient in addition to my initial orders, which included Albuterol or Atrovent q. 2h. and Levaquin 500 mg IV, as well as Solu-Medrol.,Critical care note terminates at this time.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:,  See the critical care note.,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING (DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS):,  This patient has an acute severe decompensation with respiratory failure. Given the patient’s white count and recent history of pneumonia, the possibility of recurrence of pneumonia is certainly there. Similarly, it would be difficult to rule out sepsis. Myocardial infarction cannot be excluded.,COORDINATION OF CARE:,  Dr. X was contacted from the emergency room and asked to assume the patient’s care in the Intensive Care Unit.,FINAL DIAGNOSIS:,  Respiratory failure secondary to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:, The patient is to be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

At the present time, the patient is under radiation treatment.  Two weeks ago or so, she developed a large abdominal mass, which was cystic in nature and the radiologist inserted a pigtail catheter in the emergency room.  We proceeded to admit the patient and drained a significant amount of clear fluid in the subsequent days.  The cytology of the fluid was negative and the culture was also negative.  Eventually, the patient was sent home with the pigtail shut off and the patient a week later underwent a repeat CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.,The CAT scan showed accumulation of the fluid and the mass almost achieving 80% of the previous size.  Therefore, I called the patient home and she came to the emergency department where the service was provided.  At that time, I proceeded to work on the pigtail catheter after obtaining an informed consent and preparing and draping the area in the usual fashion.  Unfortunately, the catheter was open.  I did not have a drainage system at that time.  So, I withdrew directly with a syringe 700 mL of clear fluid.  The system was connected to the draining bag, and the patient was instructed to keep a log and how to use equipment.  She was given an appointment to see me in the office next Monday, which is three days from now.",Surgery

He sustained a blunt trauma to his ribs resulting in multiple fractures and presumably also struck his mandible resulting in the above-mentioned fracture.  He was admitted to hospital in Harleton, Texas, where his initial evaluation showed the rib fractures have also showed a nodule on his right upper lobe as well as a mediastinal mass.  His mandible fracture was not noted initially.  The patient also has a history of prostate cancer and a renal cell carcinoma.  The patient at that point underwent a bronchoscopy with a biopsy of the mediastinal mass and the results of that biopsy are still pending.  The patient later saw a local oral surgeon.  He diagnosed his mandible fracture and advised him to seek treatment in Houston.  He presented to my office for evaluation on January 18, 2010, and he was found to have an extremely atrophic mandible with a fracture in the left parasymphysis region involving a failed dental implant, which had been placed approximately 15 years ago.  The patient had significant discomfort and could eat foods and drink fluids with difficulty.  Due to the nature of his fracture and the complex medical history, he was sent to the hospital for admission and following cardiac clearance, he was scheduled for surgery today.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, and placed in a supine position.  Following a nasal intubation and induction of general anesthesia, the surgeon then scrubbed, gowned, and gloved in the normal sterile fashion.  The patient was then prepped and draped in a manner consistent with sterile procedures.  A marking pen was first used to outline the incision in the submental region and it was extended from the left mandibular body to the right mandibular body region, approximately 1.5 cm medial to the inferior border of the mandible.  A 1 mL of lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then infiltrated along the incision and then a 15-blade was used to incise through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was then used to carry the dissection superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible.  Electrocautery as well as 4.0 silk ties were used for hemostasis.  A 15-blade was then used to incise the periosteum along the inferior border of the mandible and it was reflected exposing the mandible as well as the fracture site.  The fracture site was slightly distracted allowing access to the dental implant within the bone and it was easily removed from the wound.  Cultures of this site were also obtained and then the granulation tissue from the wound was also curetted free of the wound and sent for a histologic diagnosis.  Manipulation of the mandible was then used to achieve an anatomic reduction and then an 11-hole Synthes reconstruction plate was then used to stand on the fracture site.  Since there was an area of weakness in the right parasymphysis region, in the location of another dental implant, the bone plate was extended posterior to that site.  When the plate was adapted to the mandible, it was then secured to the bone with 9 screws, each being 2 mm in diameter and each screw was placed bicortically.  All the screws were also locking screws.  Following placement of the screws, there was felt to be excellent stability of the fracture, so the wound was irrigated with a copious amount of normal saline.  The incision was closed in multiple layers with 4.0 Vicryl in the muscular and subcutaneous layers and 5.0 nylon in the skin.  A sterile dressing was then placed over the incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room with spontaneous respirations and stable vital signs.  Estimated blood loss is 125 mL.",Surgery

Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  He was then placed in the supine position and sterilely prepped and draped.  Since the testis was in the ectopic position, we did an upper curvilinear scrotal incision with a 15-blade knife and further extended it with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was also used for hemostasis.  A subdartos pouch was then created with a curved tenotomy scissors.  The tunica vaginalis was grasped with a curved mosquito clamp and then dissected from its gubernacular attachments.  As we were dissecting it, we then found the testis itself into the sac, and we opened the sac, and it was found to be slightly atrophic about 12 mm in length and had a type III epididymal attachment, not being attached to the top.  We then dissected the hernia sac off of the testis __________ some traction using the straight Joseph scissors and straight and curved mosquito clamps.  Once this was dissected off, we then twisted it upon itself, and then dissected it down towards the external ring, but on traction.  We then twisted it upon itself, suture ligated it with 3-0 Vicryl and released it, allowing it to spring back into the canal.  Once this was done, we then had adequate length of the testis into the scrotal sac.  Using a curved mosquito clamp, we grasped the base of the scrotum internally, and using the subcutaneous tissue, we tacked it to the base of the testis using a 4-0 chromic suture.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  The upper aspect of the pouch was closed with a pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic.  The scrotal skin and dartos were then closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic, and Dermabond tissue adhesive was used on the incision.  IV Toradol was given.  Both testes were well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure.",Urology

Right breast was slightly larger than the left this was repaired with a basic wise pattern reduction mammoplasty with anterior pedicle.,PROCEDURE,With the patient under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the entire chest was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A previously placed mark to identify the neo-nipple site was re-identified and carefully measured for asymmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  A keyhole wire ring was then used to outline the basic wise pattern with 6-cm lamps inferiorly.  This was then carefully checked for symmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  All marks were then completed and lightly incised on both breasts.  The right breast was approached first.  The neo-nipple site was de-epithelialized superiorly and then the inferior pedicle was de-epithelialized using cutting cautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to carry down an incision along the inferior aspect of the periosteum starting immediately.  This was taken down to the prepectoral fashion dissected for short distance superiorly, and then blunt dissection was used to mobilize under the superior portion of the breast tissues to the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle.  There was very little bleeding with this procedure.  After this had been completed, attention was directed to the lateral side, and the inferior incision was made and taken down to the serratus.  Cautery dissection was then used to carry this up superiorly over the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle to communicate with the previous pocket.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut around the inferior pedicle completely freeing the superior breast from the inferior breast.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut along the superior edge of the redundant tissue and this was tapered under the superior flaps.  On the right side, there was a small palpable lobule, which had shown up on mammogram, but nothing except some fat density was identified.  This site had been previously marked carefully, and there were no unusual findings and the superior tissue was then sent out separately for pathology.  After this had been completed, final hemostasis obtained, and the wound was irrigated and a tagging suture placed to approximate the tissues.  The breast cleared and the nipple appeared good.,Attention was then directed to the left breast, which was completed in the similar manner.  After this had been completed, the patient was placed in a near upright position, and symmetry appeared good, but it was a bit poor on the lateral aspect of the right side, which was little larger and some suction lipectomy was carried out in this area.  After completion of this, 1860 grams had been removed from the right and 1505 grams was removed from the left.  Through separate stab wounds on the lateral aspect, 10-mm flat Blake drains were brought out and sutures were then placed **** and irrigated.  The wounds were then closed with interrupted 4-0 Monocryl on the deep dermis and running intradermal 4-0 Monocryl on the skin, packing sutures and staples were removed as they were approached.  The nipple was sutured with running intradermal 4-0 Monocryl.  Vascularity appeared good throughout.  After this had been completed, all wounds were cleaned and Steri-Stripped.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  All counts were correct.  Estimated blood loss was less than 150 mL, and she was sent to recovery room in good condition.",Surgery

He was presented at Tumor Board where it was thought upon review that day that he had a right nodular malignant mesothelioma.  Thus, he was offered a right thoracotomy and excision of mass with possible reconstruction of the diaphragm.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and alternatives to this procedure.  He wished to proceed, so he was brought to the operating room.,An epidural catheter was placed.  He was put in a supine position where SCDs and Foley catheter were placed.  He was put under general endotracheal anesthesia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  He was given preoperative antibiotics, then he was placed in the left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A low thoracotomy in the 7th interspace was made using the skin knife and then Bovie cautery onto the middle of the rib and then with the Alexander instrument, the chest was entered.  Upon entering the chest, the chest wall retractor was inserted and the cavity inspected.  It appeared that the mass actually arose more from the right lower lobe and was involving the diaphragm.  He also had some marked lymphadenopathy.  With these findings, which were thought at that time to be more consistent with a bronchogenic carcinoma, we proceeded with the intent to perform a right lower lobectomy and en bloc diaphragmatic resection.  Thus, we mobilized the inferior pulmonary ligament and made our way around the hilum anteriorly and posteriorly.  We also worked to open the fissure and tried to identify the arteries going to the superior portion of the right lower lobe and basilar arteries as well as the artery going to the right middle lobe.  The posterior portion of the fissure ultimately divided with the single firing of a GIA stapler with a blue load and with the final portion being divided between 2-0 ties.  Once we had clearly delineated the arterial anatomy, we were able to pass a right angle around the artery going to the superior segment.  This was ligated in continuity with an additional stick tie in the proximal portion of 3-0 silk.  This was divided thus revealing a branched artery going to the basilar portion of the right lower lobe.  This was also ligated in continuity and actually doubly ligated.  Care was taken to preserve the artery to the right and middle lobe.,We then turned our attention once again to the hilum to dissect out the inferior pulmonary vein.  The superior pulmonary vein was visualized as well.  The right angle was passed around the inferior pulmonary vein, and this was ligated in continuity with 2-0 silk and a 3-0 stick tie.  Upon division of this portion, the specimen site had some bleeding, which was eventually controlled using several 3-0 silk sutures.  The bronchial anatomy was defined.  Next, we identified the bronchus going to the right lower lobe as well as the right middle lobe.  A TA-30 4.8 stapler was then closed.  The lung insufflated.  The right middle lobe and right upper lobe were noted to inflate well.  The stapler was fired, and the bronchus was cut with a 10-blade.,We then turned our attention to the diaphragm.  There was a small portion of the diaphragm of approximately 4 to 5 cm has involved with tumor, and we bovied around this with at least 1 cm margin.  Upon going through the diaphragm, it became clear that the tumor was also involving the dome of the liver, so after going around the diaphragm in its entirety, we proceeded to wedge out the portion of liver that was involved.  It seemed that it would be a mucoid shallow portion.  The Bovie was set to high cautery.  The capsule was entered, and then using Bovie cautery, we wedged out the remaining portion of the tumor with a margin of normal liver.  It did leave quite a shallow defect in the liver.  Hemostasis was achieved with Bovie cautery and gentle pressure.  The specimen was then taken off the table and sent to Pathology for permanent.  The area was inspected for hemostasis.  A 10-flat JP was placed in the abdomen at the portion of the wedge resection, and 0 Prolene was used to close the diaphragmatic defect, which was under very little tension.  A single 32 straight chest tube was also placed.  The lung was seen to expand.  We also noted that the incomplete fissure between the middle and upper lobes would prevent torsion of the right middle lobe.  Hemostasis was observed at the end of the case.  The chest tube was irrigated with sterile water, and there was no air leak observed from the bronchial stump.  The chest was then closed with Vicryl at the level of the intercostal muscles, staying above the ribs.  The 2-0 Vicryl was used for the latissimus dorsi layer and the subcutaneous layer, and 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin.  The patient was then brought to supine position, extubated, and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.,Dr. X was present for the entirety of the procedure, which was a right thoracotomy, right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and a portion of liver.",Hematology - Oncology

4334,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is well known to me for a history of iron-deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss from colitis.  We corrected her hematocrit last year with intravenous (IV) iron.  Ultimately, she had a total proctocolectomy done on 03/14/2007 to treat her colitis.  Her course has been very complicated since then with needing multiple surgeries for removal of hematoma.  This is partly because she was on anticoagulation for a right arm deep venous thrombosis (DVT) she had early this year, complicated by septic phlebitis.,Chart was reviewed, and I will not reiterate her complex history.,I am asked to see the patient again because of concerns for coagulopathy.,She had surgery again last month to evacuate a pelvic hematoma, and was found to have vancomycin resistant enterococcus, for which she is on multiple antibiotics and followed by infectious disease now.,She is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as well.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Labs today showed a white blood count of 7.9, hemoglobin 11.0, hematocrit 32.8, and platelets 1,121,000.  MCV is 89.  Her platelets have been elevated for at least the past week, with counts initially at the 600,000 to 700,000 range and in the last couple of day rising above 1,000,000.  Her hematocrit has been essentially stable for the past month or so.  White blood count has improved.,PT has been markedly elevated and today is 44.9 with an INR of 5.0.  This is despite stopping Coumadin on 05/31/2007, and with administration of vitamin K via the TPN, as well as additional doses IV.  The PT is slightly improved over the last few days, being high at 65.0 with an INR of 7.3 yesterday.,PTT has not been checked since 05/18/2007 and was normal then at 28.,LFTs have been elevated.  ALT is 100, AST 57, GGT 226, alkaline phosphatase 505, albumin low at 3.3, uric acid high at 4.9, bilirubin normal, LDH normal, and pre-albumin low at 16.  Creatinine is at 1.5, with an estimated creatinine clearance low at 41.7.  Other electrolytes are fairly normal.,B12 was assessed on 05/19/2007 and was normal at 941.  Folic acid was normal.  Iron saturation has not been checked since March, and was normal then.  Ferritin has not been checked in a couple of months.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Erythropoietin 45,000 units every week, started 05/16/2007.  She is on heparin flushes, loperamide, niacin, pantoprazole, Diovan, Afrin nasal spray, caspofungin, daptomycin, Ertapenem, fentanyl or morphine p.r.n. pain, and Compazine or Zofran p.r.n. nausea.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: ,GENERAL:  She is alert, and frustrated with her prolonged hospital stay.  She notes that she had epistaxis a few days ago, requiring nasal packing and fortunately that had resolved now.,VITAL SIGNS:  Today, temperature is 98.5, pulse 99, respirations 16, blood pressure 105/65, and pulse is 95.  She is not requiring oxygen.,SKIN:  No significant ecchymoses are noted.,ABDOMEN:  Ileostomy is in place, with greenish black liquid output.  Midline surgical scar has healed well, with a dressing in place in the middle, with no bleeding noted.,EXTREMITIES:  She has no peripheral edema.,CARDIAC:  Regular rate.,LYMPHATICS:  No adenopathy is noted.,LUNGS:  Clear bilaterally.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  Markedly elevated PT/INR despite stopping Coumadin and administering vitamin K.  I will check mixing studies to see if she has deficiency, which could be due to poor production given her elevated LFTs, decreased albumin, and decreased pre-albumin.,It is possible that she has an inhibitor, which would have to be an acquired inhibitor, generally presenting with an elevated PTT and not PT.  I will check a PTT and check mixing studies if that is prolonged.  It is doubtful that she has a lupus anticoagulant since she has been presenting with bleeding symptoms rather than clotting.  I agree with continuing off of anticoagulation for now.,She has markedly elevated platelet count.  I suspect this is likely reactive to infection, and not from a new myeloproliferative disorder.,Anemia has been stable, and is multifactorial.  Given her decreased creatinine clearance, I agree with erythropoietin support.  She was iron deficient last year, and with her multiple surgeries and poor p.o. intake, may have become iron deficient again.  She has had part of her small bowel removed, so there may be a component of poor absorption as well.  If she is iron deficient, this may contribute also to her elevated platelet counts.  I will check a ferritin.  This may be difficult to interpret because of inflammation.  If it is decreased, plan will be to add iron supplementation intravenously.  If it is elevated, we could consider a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate her iron stores, and also assess her myelopoiesis given the markedly elevated platelet counts.,She needs continued treatment as you are for her infections.,I will discuss the case with Dr. X as well since there is a question as to whether she might need additional surgery.  She is not a surgical candidate now with her elevated PT/INR.",Consult - History and Phy.
3093,"ALLOWED CONDITIONS:,  Sprain of left knee and leg.,CONTESTED CONDITION:,  Left knee tear medial meniscus, left knee ACL tear.,EMPLOYER:,  YYYY,REQUESTING PARTY:,  XXXX,Mr. XXXXXX is a xx-year-old male who was evaluated for an independent medical examination on September 20, 2007, because of an injury sustained to the left leg.  The injured worker does state that he was working as a processor for the ABCD Company on July 18, 2007, when he injured his left knee.  He does state he was working in a catwalk when he stepped up.  He noticed his sight glass was not open on the tank.  He then stepped straight down and his knee went sideways.  His knee popped and he sat down secondary to discomfort.  At that time he could not do any type of activity secondary to the pain.  The nurse called the ambulance subsequent to this injury and he was taken to Bethesda North.  X-rays were obtained which demonstrated no evidence of fracture.  Thereafter, he was referred to X who he saw on July 19, 2007.  It was felt that a MRI scan about the knee needed to be obtained and it was obtained on July 24.  It was noted that there was evidence of an anterior cruciate ligament tear and a slight medial meniscal tear.  On his second visit, it was felt that arthroscopic surgery intervention was indicated as related to the left knee.,On September 7, 2007, he underwent surgical intervention at ABC for the anterior cruciate reconstruction as well as the partial medial meniscectomy.,At the present time, he is progressing along with physical therapy.  He is utilizing one crutch.,He does admit to significant bruising and swelling about the left lower extremity.  If he does indeed move too fast, the discomfort is increased.  His pain about the left knee is approximately 6 to 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.,He has had injuries to the right knee in which he wrecked his bicycle and did have some type of fracture bone spur when he was 13 years of age.,He underwent arthroscopic surgery as related to the right knee at that time and really did quite well.,His next appointment with Dr. X is on October 4, 2007.,The injured worker denies any previous history of similar problems as related to the left knee.,MEDICATIONS: , Glucophage, Lipitor, Actos, Benicar, glimepiride, and Januvia.,SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Arthroscopic surgery of the left knee and arthroscopic surgery of the right knee.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient denies alcohol consumption.  He does smoke approximately one and a half packs of cigarettes per day.  His education is that of 12th grade.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , This is a healthy appearing 34-year-old male who is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 285 pounds.  He does not appear to be in distress at this time.  Examination is limited to the left knee.  One could appreciate a healed scar as related to the inferior pole inferior to the patella.  There are healed arthroscopic scars as well.  The range of motion of left knee reveals 50 to 70 degrees of flexion.  There is evidence of medial and lateral joint line discomfort.  Anterior Lachman's test was negative.  No evidence of atrophy is noted.  There is weakness with aggressive function about the quadriceps and hamstring musculature.,The patient is ambulating with one crutch at this time.,There is mild degree of swelling as related to the left knee.  Deep tendon reflexes are +2/+2 bilaterally symmetrical.  Sensory examination was normal as related to the foot, but abnormal as related to the left knee.,I did review pictures that were taken at the time of the surgery, which demonstrates the meniscectomy and the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,MEDICAL RECORDS REVIEW:,1.  July 18, 2007, x-rays of the left knee demonstrated evidence of a small suprapatellar joint effusion.  It should be noted that the exam demonstrated evidence of medial and lateral joint line discomfort.  There was specific mention of intraarticular effusion.,2.  On July 27, 2007, MRI scan of the left knee was obtained, which demonstrated evidence of the complete tear of the mid to distal ACL.  Findings suggestive of a chronic injury.  Grade I sprain of the MCL was noted.  Contusion __________ plateau medial femoral condyle and lateral femoral condyle was noted.  There was evidence of a small peripheral longitudinal tear of the posterior horn of medial meniscus.  Chondromalacia of the lateral femoral condyle and patella was noted.  It should be noted that the changes of degeneration of the cartilages of the injured worker's knee and the chronic anterior cruciate ligament changes were noted related to the July 18, 2007, injury.,3.  July 18, 2007, first report of injury, occupational disease, and/or death.,4.  Evaluations of ABCD Hospital.  It should be noted that the mechanism of injury was such that he was walking down the stairs when his left knee locked up.,5.  July 18, 2007, x-rays of the left knee were obtained, which demonstrated the evidence of no acute fracture or significant osteoarthritis.  There is evidence there maybe a small suprapatellar joint effusion.,6.  Notes from the office of Dr. X. It should be noted on physical examination his range of motion is 8 to 20 degrees.,7.  Physical therapy prescription for __________ Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Corporation.,8.  August 10, 2007, requests for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with patellar tendon.,9.  Physician narrative of August 24, 2007.  It is noted that the injured worker did indeed have evidence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.  His BMI was 42.  This was felt __________ pre-injury MRI scan.,Following your review of the medical information and your physical examination, please answer the following questions as these pertain to the allowed conditions.  Please express your opinion based upon a reasonable degree of medical probability.,QUESTION: ,Mr. XXXXXX has filed an application for the additional allowance of left knee tear of the medial meniscus and left knee ACL tear.,Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, or and medical records or diagnosis studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of any of the requested conditions.,ANSWER: ,The MRI sustains and verifies that these conditions do indeed exist subsequent to the injury of July 18, 2007.,QUESTION: ,If you find any of these conditions exist, are they a direct and proximate result of the July 18, 2007, injury.,ANSWER: ,There is mention of degeneration as related to the knee prior to this episode.  This is not surprising considering the individual's weight.  There is no question degeneration as related to anterior cruciate ligament and the meniscus has been occurring for a lengthy period of time.  There has been an aggravation of this condition.  Without having a MRI to review prior to this injury, I believe, it would be safe to assume that there has been aggravation of a pre-existing condition as related to the left knee and __________ meniscal and anterior cruciate ligament pathology.  Thus there is definitely evidence of an aggravation of a pre-existing condition but not necessarily a direct and proximate result of the July 18, 2007, injury.,QUESTION: ",IME-QME-Work Comp etc.
242,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Open angle glaucoma OX,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Open angle glaucoma OX,PROCEDURE:, Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C, XXX eye 0.3 c per mg times three minutes.,INDICATIONS: ,This is a XX-year-old (wo)man with glaucoma in the OX eye, uncontrolled by maximum tolerated medical therapy.,PROCEDURE: ,The risks and benefits of glaucoma surgery were discussed at length with the patient including bleeding, infection, reoperation, retinal detachment, diplopia, ptosis, loss of vision, and loss of the eye, corneal hemorrhage hypotony, elevated pressure, worsening of glaucoma, and corneal edema. Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox, Ocular, and pilocarpine. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. Vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. This was dissected posteriorly with Vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. Residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with Eraser-tip cautery. Sponges soaked in mitomycin C 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. Sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. A Super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. This was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. A temporal paracentesis was then made. Scleral flap was lifted and a Super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. A Kelly-Descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. The anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. Conjunctiva was then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle at each of the peritomy ends. Then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 Vicryl suture was placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. The conjunctival peritomy was checked for any leaks and was noted to be watertight using Weck- cel sponge. The anterior chamber was inflated and there was noted that the superior bleb was well formed. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was formed and the pressure was felt to be adequate. Speculum and drapes were carefully removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Atropine was also placed over the eye. Then an eye patch and eye shield were placed over the eye. The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no complications.",Surgery
3420,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 74-year-old white woman who has a past medical history of hypertension for 15 years, history of CVA with no residual hemiparesis and uterine cancer with pulmonary metastases, who presented for evaluation of recent worsening of the hypertension.  According to the patient, she had stable blood pressure for the past 12-15 years on 10 mg of lisinopril.  In August of 2007, she was treated with doxorubicin and, as well as Procrit and her blood pressure started to go up to over 200s.  Her lisinopril was increased to 40 mg daily.  She was also given metoprolol and HCTZ two weeks ago, after she visited the emergency room with increased systolic blood pressure.  Denies any physical complaints at the present time.  Denies having any renal problems in the past.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  As above plus history of anemia treated with Procrit.  No smoking or alcohol use and lives alone.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Unremarkable.,PRESENT MEDICATIONS: , As above.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Cardiovascular:  No chest pain.  No palpitations.  Pulmonary:  No shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing.  Gastrointestinal:  No nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  GU:  No nocturia.  Denies having gross hematuria.  Salt intake is minimal.  Neurological:  Unremarkable, except for history of old CVA.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Blood pressure today is 182/78.  Examination of the head is unremarkable.  Neck is supple with no JVD.  Lungs are clear.  There is no abdominal bruit.  Extremities 1+ edema bilaterally.,LABORATORY DATA:,  Urinalysis done in the office shows 1+ proteinuria; same is shown by urinalysis done at Hospital.  The creatinine is 0.8.  Renal ultrasound showed possible renal artery stenosis and a 2 cm cyst in the left kidney.  MRA of the renal arteries was essentially unremarkable with no suspicion for renal artery stenosis.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  Accelerated hypertension.  No clear-cut etiology for recent worsening since renal artery stenosis was ruled out by negative MRA.  I could only blame Procrit initiation, as well as possible fluid retention as a cause of the patient's accelerated hypertension.  She was started on hydrochlorothiazide less than two weeks ago with some improvement in her hypertension.  At this point, I would not pursue a diagnosis of renal artery stenosis.  Since she is maxed out on lisinopril and her pulse is 60, I would not increase beta-blocker or ACE inhibitor.  I will continue HCTZ at 24 mg daily.  The patient was also given a sample of Tekturna, which would hopefully improve her systolic blood pressure.  The patient was told to be stick with her salt intake.  She will report to me in 10 days with the result of her blood pressure.  She will also repeat an SMA7 to rule out possible hyperkalemia due to Tekturna.",General Medicine
3871,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 68-year-old woman whom I have been following, who has had angina.  In any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when I spoke to her.  I advised her to call 911, which she did.  While waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain.  By the time she presented here, she is currently pain-free and is feeling well.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , The patient has been having arm pain for several months.  She underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia.  I had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker.  However, her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room.  On 08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80%  mid LAD lesion, circumflex normal, and RCA totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right, as well as right to right to that area.  The decision was made to transfer  her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the LAD stenosis to the RCA vessel.  She underwent that with drug-eluting stents on 08/16/08, with I believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08.  She had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild.  Yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin.  This is her usual angina.  She is being admitted with unstable angina post stent.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Longstanding hypertension, CAD as above, hyperlipidemia, and overactive bladder.,MEDICATIONS:,1.  Detrol LA 2 mg once a day.,2.  Prilosec for GERD 20 mg once a day.,3.  Glucosamine 500/400 mg once a day for arthritis.,4.  Multivitamin p.o. daily.,5.  Nitroglycerin sublingual as available to her.,6.  Toprol-XL 25 mg once a day which I started although she had been bradycardic, but she seems to be tolerating.,7.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.,8.  Plavix 75 mg once a day.,9.  Diovan 160 mg once a day.,10.  Claritin 10 mg once a day for allergic rhinitis.,11.  Norvasc 5 mg once a day.,12.  Lipitor 5 mg once a day.,13.  Evista 60 mg once a day.,ALLERGIES: , ALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS ARE NONE.  SHE DENIES ANY SHRIMP OR SEA FOOD ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Her father died of an MI in his 50s and a brother had his first MI and bypass surgery at 54.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, no use of illicit drugs.  She is divorced and lives alone and is a retired laboratory technician from Cornell Diagnostic Laboratory.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting up blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi, cholelithiasis, asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, home oxygen use or sleep apnea, although she has been told in the past that she snores and there was some question of apnea in 05/08.  No morning headaches or fatigue.  No psychiatric diagnosis.  No psoriasis, no lupus.  Remainder of the review of systems is negative x14 systems except as described above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  She is a pleasant elderly woman, currently in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  Height 4 feet 11 inches, weight 128 pounds, temperature 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure 142/70, pulse 47,  respiratory rate 16, and O2 saturation 100%,HEENT:  Cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.,NECK:  Veins are not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion without wheezes.,HEART:  S1 and S2, regular rate.  No significant murmurs, rubs or gallops.  PMI nondisplaced.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.,EXTREMITIES:  Without significant clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Pulses grossly intact.  Bilateral groins are inspected, status post as the right femoral artery was used for access for the diagnostic cardiac catheterization here and left femoral artery used for PCI and there is no evidence of hematoma or bruit and intact distal pulses.,LABORATORY DATA: , EKG reviewed which shows sinus bradycardia at the rate of 51 beats per minute and no acute disease.,Sodium 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 105, and bicarbonate 27.  BUN 16 and creatinine 0.9.  Glucose 110.  Magnesium 2.5.  ALT 107 and AST 65 and these were normal on 08/15/08.  INR is 0.89, PTT 20.9, white blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 31 and it was 35 on 08/15/08, and platelet count 257,000.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 68-year-old woman with exertional angina, characterized with arm pain, who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery.  In any case, given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free, I am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy.  We will continue her beta-blocker and I cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already.  Aspirin, Plavix, valsartan, Lipitor, and Norvasc.  I am going to add Imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out MI, although there is a little suspicion.  I suppose it is possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect.  My concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal LV function.  She will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis, Claritin for allergies, and Detrol LA for urinary incontinence.,Total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes.

Rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATION:  ,The patient is an unfortunate 6-month-old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites.  The patient has been treated somewhat successfully with TPN and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces.  Last week, Dr. X took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically.  However at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen.  Dr. X opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole.  This was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease.  We met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient's abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended.  Exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity.  What we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon.  It appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery.  There was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved, but I did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient's small bowel would be viable surgical option.  Instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that.,The lymphatic abnormality was extensive.  They were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery.  They were small aneurysm-like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well.  No other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified.  Both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow.  We conducted a surgical time-out and reiterated all of the patient's important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above.  Preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia.  As the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between Vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described.  The bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient's chylous ascites.  The small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75% of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for The patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems.  Furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option.  We suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient's abdominal incision with 4-0 PDS on the posterior sheath and 3-0 PDS on the anterior rectus sheath.  Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for skin closure.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He lost minimal blood, but did lose approximately 100 mL of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak.  The patient was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management, which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an Intestinal Transplantation Center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time.",Gastroenterology

Tethered brachial artery, left elbow.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Closed reduction percutaneous pinning, left distal humerus.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in the inpatient operating suite, room #2 at ABCD General Hospital.  A portion of the procedure was done in consult with Dr. X with separate dictation by him.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:  ,This is a 4-year-old white male, apparently dominantly right-handed who suffered a severe injury to his left distal humerus after jumping off of a swing.  He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm.  He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow.  His parents' were both present preoperatively.  His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region.  Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible.  He did have a radial pulse palpable.,PROCEDURE: , After discussing the alternatives of the case as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations with the patient's parents including malunion, nonunion, gross deformity, growth arrest, infection, loss of elbow motions, stiffness, instability, need for surgery in the future, nerve problems, artery problems, and compartment syndrome, they elected to proceed.,The patient was laid supine upon operative table after receiving general anesthetic by Anesthesia Department.  Closed reduction was accomplished in a sequential manner.  Milking of the soft tissue envelope was carried out to try and reduce the shaft of the humerus back into its plane relative to the brachialis muscle and the neurovascular bundle anteriorly.  Then a slow longitudinal traction was carried out.  The elbow was hyperflexed.  Pressure placed upon the olecranon tip and two 0.045 K-wires placed first, one being on the lateral side and with this placement on the medial side of medial epicondyle with care taken to protect the ulnar nerve.  The close reduction was deemed to be acceptable once viewed on C-arm.,After this, pulse was attempted to be palpated distally.  Prior to the procedure, I talked to Dr. X of Vascular Surgery at ABCD Hospital.  He had scrubbed in to the case to follow up on the loss of the radial artery distally.  This was not present palpatory, but also by Doppler.  A weak ulnar artery pulse was present via Doppler.  Because of this, the severe displacement of the injury and the fact that the Doppler sound had an occlusion-type sound just above the fracture site or _______.  A long discussion was carried out with Dr. X and myself, and we decided to proceed with exploration of the brachial artery.  Prior to this, I went out to the waiting room to discuss with the patient's parents, the reasoning what we are going to do and the reasoning for this.  I then came back in and then we proceeded.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Please see Dr. X's report for the discussion of the exploration and release of the brachial artery.  There was no indication that it was actually in the fracture site, the soft tissue had tethered in its right angle towards the fracture site, thus reducing its efficiency of providing blood distally.  Once it was released, both clinically on the table as well as by Doppler, the patient had bounding pulses.,We then proceeded to close utilizing a #4-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous fat closure and a running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch for skin closure.  Steri-Strips were placed.  The patient's arm was placed in just a slight degree of flexion with a neutral position.  He was splinted posteriorly.  Adaptic and fluffs have been placed around the patient's pin sites.  K-wires have been bent, cut, and pin caps placed.,Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded for the obvious reasons noted above.  There is concern for growth plate disturbance.  He will be watched very closely for the potential development of re-perfusing compartment syndrome.,A full and complete neurologic exam will be impossible tonight, but will be carried on a sequential basis starting tomorrow morning.  There is always a potential for loss of elbow motion, overall cosmetic elbow alignment, and elbow function.",Orthopedic

Insertion of tissue expander to the lateral wound.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,TOURNIQUET: , None.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,INDICATIONS: , This patient developed a compartment syndrome.  She underwent 4 compartment fasciotomy with dual incision on medial and lateral aspect of the right lower leg.  She was doing very well and was obviously improving.,The swelling was reduced.  A compartment pressure had obviously improved based on examination.  She was therefore indicated for placement of tissue expander for ventral wound closure.  The risks of procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure were discussed at length with the patient and he understood them well.  Risks and benefits were all discussed, risk of bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgery, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  She understood them well.  All questions were answered, and she signed the consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The medial wound was noted to be approximately 10.5 cm in length x 4 cm.  The lateral wound was noted in approximately 14 cm in length x 5 x 5 cm in width.  Both wounds were then thoroughly debrided.  The debridement of both wounds included skin and subcutaneous tissue and nonviable muscle portion.  This involve very small portion of muscle as well as skin edge and the subcutaneous tissue did require debridement on both sides.  At this point adequate debridement was performed and healthy tissue did appear to be present.  Initially on the medial wound I did place the DermaClose RC continuous external tissue expander.  On the medial wound the 5 skin anchors were placed on each side of the wound and separated appropriately.  I then did place the line loop from the tension controller in a lace like manner through the skin anchors and the tension controller was attached to the middle anchor.  I then did place adequate tension on the sutures.  Continued tension will be noted after engaging the tension controller.  At this point I performed the similar procedure to the lateral wound.  The skin anchors were placed separately and appropriately on either side of the skin margin.  The line loop from the tension controller was placed in lace like manner through the skin anchors.  The tension controller was then attached to the mid anchor and appropriate tension was applied.,It must be noted I did undermine the skin edges both sides of flap from both incision site prior to placement of the skin anchor and adequate mobilization was obtained.  Adequate tension was placed in this region.  A non thick dressing was then applied to the open-wound region and sterile dressing was then applied.  No complications were encountered throughout the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.",Orthopedic

I had a long discussion with him concerning variety of options.  We talked in particular about extirpated versus ablative surgery.  Based on his young age and excellent state of health, decision was made at this point to proceed to a right partial nephrectomy laparoscopically.  All questions were answered, and he wished to proceed with surgery as planned.  Note that the patient does have a positive family history of renal cell carcinoma.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After acquisition of proper informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  After institution of adequate general anesthetic via endotracheal rod, he was placed into the right anterior flank position with his right side elevated on a roll and his right arm across his chest.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and he was securely taped to the table.  Note that sequential compression devices were in place on both lower extremities and were activated prior to induction of anesthesia.  His abdomen was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Note that a #16-French Foley catheter was in place per urethra as well as an orogastric tube.  The abdomen was insufflated at the right lateral abdomen using the Veress needle to a pressure of 15 without incident.  We then placed a Visiport 10 x 12 trocar in the right lateral abdomen.  With the trocar in place, we were able to place the remaining trocars under direct laparoscopic visualization.  We placed three additional trocars.  An 11 mm screw type trocar at the umbilicus, a 6 screw type trocar 7 cm in the midline above the umbilicus, and a 10 x 12 trocar to serve as a retractor port approximately 8 cm inferior in the midline.,The procedure was begun by reflecting the right colon by incising the white line of Toldt.  The colon was reflected medially, and the retroperitoneum was exposed on that side.  This was a fairly superficial lesion, so decision was made in advance to potentially not perform vascular clamping, however, I did feel it important to get high level control prior to proceeding to the partial.  With the colon reflected, the duodenum was identified, and it was reflected medially under Kocher maneuver.  The ureter and gonadal vein were identified on the right side and elevated.  The space between the ureter and the gonadal vein was then developed, and the gonadal vein was dropped elevating only the ureter, and carrying this plane dissection up towards the renal hilum.  Once we got up to the renal hilum, we were able to skeletonize the renal hilar vessels partially, and in particular, we did develop some of the upper pole dissection above the level of the hilum to provide for access for a Satinsky clamp or bulldogs.  The remainder of the kidney was then freed off its lateral and superior attachments primarily using the Harmonic scalpel and the LigaSure device.,With the kidney free and the hilum prepared, the Gerota fascia was taken down overlying the kidney exposing the renal parenchyma, and using this approach, we were able to identify the 2-cm, right renal mass located in the lower pole laterally.  A cap of fat was left overlying this mass.  Based on the position of the mass, we performed intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound, which showed the mass to be somewhat deeper than initially anticipated.  Based on this finding, I decided to go ahead and clamp the renal hilum during resection.  A Satinsky clamp was introduced through the lower most trocar site and used to clamp the renal hilum en bloc.  Note that the patient had been receiving renal protection protocol including fenoldopam and mannitol throughout the procedure, and he also received Lasix prior to clamping the renal hilum.  With the renal hilum clamped, we did resect the tumor using cold scissors.  There was somewhat more bleeding than would be expected based on the hilar clamping; however, we were able to successfully resect this lesion.  We also took a biopsy at the base of the resection and passed off the table as a specimen for frozen section.  With the tumor resected, the base of the resection was then cauterized using the Argon beam coagulator, and several bleeding vessels were oversewn using figure-of-eight 3-0 Vicryl sutures with lap ties for tensioning.  We then placed a FloSeal into the wound and covered it with a Surgicel and held the pressure.  We then released the vascular clamp.  Total clamp time was 11 minutes.  There was minimal bleeding and occlusion of this maneuver, and after unclamping the kidney, the kidney pinked up appropriately and appeared well perfused after removal of the clamp.  We then replaced the kidney within its Gerota envelope and closed that with 3-0 Vicryl using lap ties for tensioning.  A JP drain was introduced through the right flank and placed adjacent to the kidney and sutured the skin with 2-0 nylon.  The specimen was placed into a 10-mm Endocatch bag and extracted from the lower most trocar site after extending it approximately 1 cm.  It was evaluated on the table and passed off the table for Pathology to evaluate.  They stated that the tumor was close to the margin, but there appeared to be 1-2 mm normal parenchyma around the tumor.  In addition, the frozen section biopsies from the base of the resection were negative for renal cell carcinoma.  Based on these findings, the lower most trocar site was closed using a running 0 Vicryl suture in the fascia.  We then re-insufflated the abdomen and carefully evaluated the entire intraoperative field for hemostasis.  Any bleeding points were controlled primarily using bipolar cautery or hemoclips.  The area was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The colon was then replaced into its normal anatomic position.  The mesentry was evaluated.  There were no defects noted.  We closed the 10 x 12 lateral most trocar site using a Carter-Thompson closure device with 0-Vicryl.  All trocars were removed under direct visualization, and the abdomen was desufflated prior to removal of the last trocar.  The skin incisions were irrigated with normal saline and infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine, and the skin was closed using a running 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Benzoin and Steri-Strips were placed.  The patient was returned in supine position and awoken from general anesthetic without incident.  He was then transferred to hospital gurney and taken to the postanesthesia care unit for postoperative monitoring.  At the end of the case, sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct.  I was scrubbed and present throughout the entire case.",Nephrology

Palacos cement with antibiotics x2 batches.,INDICATION: , The patient is an 84-year-old female with significant endstage osteoarthritis of the left knee, who has had rapid progression with pain and disability.  Surgery was indicated to relieve her pain and improve her functional ability.  Goal objectives and the procedure were discussed with the patient.  Risks and benefits were explained.  No guarantees have been made or implied.  Informed consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and once an adequate spinal anesthesia with Duramorph was achieved, her left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed proximally in the thigh.  Antibiotics were infused prior to Foley catheter insertion.  Time-out procedure was called.,A straight longitudinal anterior midline incision was made.  Dissection was carried down sharply down the skin, subcutaneous tissue and the fascia.  Deep fascia was exposed.  The tourniquet was inflated at 300 mmHg prior to the skin incision.  A standard medial parapatellar approach was made.  The quadriceps tendon was incised approximately 1 cm from the vastus medialis insertion.  Incision was then carried down distally and distal arthrotomy was completed.  Patellar tendon was well protected.  Retinaculum and capsule was incised approximately 5 mm from the medial border of the patella for later repair.  The knee was exposed very well.  Significant tricompartmental osteoarthritis was noted.  The osteophytes were removed with a rongeur.  Anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments were excised.  Medial and lateral meniscectomies were performed.  Medial dissection was performed subperiosteally along the medial aspect of the proximal tibia to address the varus deformity.  The medial compartment was more affected than lateral.  Medial ligaments were tied.  Retropatellar fat pad was excised.  Osteophytes were removed.  Using a Cobb elevator, the medial soft tissue periosteum envelope was well reflected.,Attention was placed for the preparation of the femur.  The trochlear notch was ossified.  A rongeur was utilized to identify the notch and then using an intramedullary drill guide, a starting hole was created slightly anterior to the PCL attachment.  The anterior portal was 1 cm anterior to the PCL attachment.  The anterior femoral sizer was positioned keeping 3 degrees of external rotation.  Rotation was also verified using the transepicondylar axis and Whiteside line.  The pins were positioned in the appropriate holes.  Anterior femoral cut was performed after placing the cutting guide.  Now, the distal cutting guide was attached to the alignment and 5 degrees of valgus cut was planned.  A distal femoral cut was made which was satisfactory.  A sizer was positioned which was noted to be D.  The 5-in-1 cutting block size D was secured with spring pins over the resected bone.  Using an oscillating saw, cuts were made in a sequential manner such as anterior condyle, posterior condyle, anterior chamfer, and posterior chamfer.  Then using a reciprocating saw, intercondylar base notch cut and side cuts were made.  Following this, the cutting block for High-Flex knee was positioned taking 2 mm of additional posterior condyle.  Using a reciprocating saw, the side cuts were made and bony intercondylar notch cut was completed.  The bone with its attached soft tissue was removed.  Once the femoral preparation was completed, attention was placed for the preparation of the tibia.  The medial and the lateral collateral ligaments were well protected with a retractor.  The PCL retractor was positioned and the tibia was translated anteriorly.  Osteophytes were removed.  The extramedullary tibial alignment guide was affixed to the tibia and appropriate amount of external rotation was considered reference to the medial 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle.  Similarly, horseshoe alignment guide was positioned and the alignment guide was well aligned to the distal 1/3rd of the crest of the tibia as well as the 2nd toe.  Once the alignment was verified in a coronal plane, the tibial EM guide was well secured and then posterior slope was also aligned keeping the alignment rod parallel to the tibial crest.  A built-in 7-degree posterior slope was considered with instrumentation.  Now, the 2 mm stylus arm was positioned over the cutting block medially, which was the most affected site.  Tibial osteotomy was completed 90 degrees to the mechanical axis in the coronal plane.  The resected thickness of the bone was satisfactory taken 2 mm from the most affected site.  The resected surface shows some sclerotic bone medially.  Now, attention was placed for the removal of the posterior osteophytes from the femoral condyle.  Using curved osteotome, angle curette, and a rongeur, the posterior osteophytes were removed.  Now, attention was placed for confirming the flexion-extension gap balance using a 10 mm spacer block in extension and 12 mm in flexion.  Rectangular gap was achieved with appropriate soft tissue balance in both flexion and extension.  The 12 mm spacer block was satisfactory with good stability in flexion and extension.,Attention was now placed for completion of the tibia.  Size 2 tibial trial plate was positioned.  Appropriate external rotation was maintained with the help of the horseshoe alignment rod.  Reference to the tibial crest distally and 2nd toe was considered as before.  The midpoint of the trial tray was collinear with the medial 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle.  The rotation of tibial plate was satisfactory as required and the preparation of the tibia was completed with intramedullary drill followed by broach impactor.  At this point, trial femoral and tibial components were reduced using a 12 mm trial liner.  The range of motion and stability in both flexion and extension was satisfactory.  No further soft tissue release was indicated.  I was able to achieve 0 degrees of extension and complete flexion of the knee.,Attention was now placed for the preparation of the patella.  Using a patellar caliper, the thickness was measured to be 21.5 mm.  This gives an ideal resection of 8.5 mm keeping 13 mm of bone intact.  Reaming was initiated with a patellar reamer reaming up to 13 mm with the reaming alignment guide.  Using a caliper, the resected patella was measured, which was noted to be 13 mm.  A 32 sizer was noted to accommodate the resected surface very well.  Drilling was completed and trial 32 button was inserted without any difficulty.  The tracking was satisfactory.  There was no evidence of any subluxation or dislocation of the patella.  The trial components position was satisfactory.  The alignment and the rotation of all 3 components were satisfactory.  All the trial components were removed and the wound was thoroughly irrigated with Pulsavac lavage irrigation mechanical system.  The resected surfaces were dried with a sponge.  Two batches of Palacos cement were mixed.  The cementing was initiated starting with tibia followed by femur and patella.  Excess peripheral cement were removed with the curette and knife.  The knee was positioned in extension with a 12 mm trial liner.  Patellar clamp was placed after cementing the all-poly patella.  Once the cement was set hard and cured, tourniquet was deflated.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The trial 12 mm liner was replaced with definitive Prolong highly cross-linked polyethylene liner.  Range of motion and stability was verified at 0 degrees and flexion of 120 degrees.  Anterior-posterior drawer test was satisfactory.  Medial and lateral stability was satisfactory.  Patellar tracking was satisfactory.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis was achieved.  A local cocktail was injected, which included the mixture of 0.25% plain Marcaine, 30 mg of Toradol, and 4 mg of morphine.  The quadriceps mechanism and distal arthrotomy was repaired with #1 Vicryl in figure-of-8 fashion.  The subcutaneous closure was performed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl and 0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl proximally.  The skin was approximated with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed including Xeroform, 4x4, ABD, and Bias.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications noted.  She tolerated the procedure very well.",Surgery

The patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin.  She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas.  She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back.  The patient desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal.  Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.,Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered as well as the operating table.  The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot.  The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted.  A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence.  At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum.  A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone.  The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time.  A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone.  An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone.  After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf.  The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area.  Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible.  Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone.  The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted.  The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted.  The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed.,Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal.  There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal.  Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon.  The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head.  Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly.  At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal.  A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences.,All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted.  The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line.  Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites.  Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.

He has previously undergone total burn excision with placement of Integra and an initial round of epidermal autografting to the bilateral upper extremities and hands.  His donor sites have healed particularly over his buttocks and he returns for a second round of epidermal autografting over the Integra on his back utilizing the buttock donor sites, the extent they will provide coverage.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:,1.  Variable take of Integra, particularly centrally and inferiorly on the back.  A fair amount of lost Integra over the upper back and shoulders.,2.  No evidence of infection.,3.  Healthy viable wound beds prior to grafting.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and positioned supine.  General endotracheal anesthesia was uneventfully induced and an appropriate time out was performed.  He was then repositioned prone and perioperative IV antibiotics were administered.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  All staples were removed from the Integra and the adherent areas of Silastic were removed.  The entire wound bed was further prepped with scrub brushes and more Betadine followed by a sulfamylon solution.  Hemostasis of the wound bed was ensured using epinephrine-soaked Telfa pads.  Following dermal tumescence of the buttocks, epidermal autografts were harvested 8 one-thousandths of an inch using the air Zimmer dermatome.  These grafts were passed to the back table where they were meshed 3:1.  The donor sites were hemostased using epinephrine-soaked Telfa and lap pads.  Once all the  grafts were meshed, we brought them back up onto the field, positioned them over the wounds beginning inferiorly and moving cephalad where we had best areas of Integra engraftment.  We were happy with the lie of the grafts and they were stapled into place.  The grafts were then overlaid with Conformant 2, which was also stapled into place.  Utilizing all of his buttocks skin, we did not have enough to cover his entire back, so we elected to apply allograft to the cephalad and a few areas on his flanks where we had had poor Integra engraftment.  Allograft was thawed and meshed 1:1.  It was then brought up onto the field, trimmed to fit and stapled into place over the wound.  Once the entirety of the posterior wounds on his back were covered out with epidermal autograft or allograft sulfamylon soaked dressings were applied.  Donor sites on his buttocks were dressed in Acticoat and secured with staples.  He was then repositioned supine and extubated in the operating room having tolerated the procedure without any apparent complications.

Laparoscopic findings demonstrated a 8 cm x 10 cm smooth right ovarian cyst that was noted to be torsed twice.  Otherwise, the uterus, left tube and ovary, bowel, liver margins, appendix, and gallbladder were noted all to be within normal limits.  There was no noted blood in the pelvis.,INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE:,  The patient is a 26-year-old G1 P1 who presented to ABCD General Emergency Room with complaint of right lower quadrant pain since last night, which has been increasing in intensity.  The pain persisted despite multiple pain medications given in the Emergency Room.  The patient reports positive nausea and vomiting.  There was no vaginal bleeding or discharge.  There was no fevers or chills.  Her cultures done in the Emergency Room were pending.  The patient did have an ultrasound that demonstrated an 8 cm right ovarian cyst, questionable hemorrhagic.  The uterus and left ovary were within normal limits.  There was a positive flow noted to bilateral ovaries on ultrasound.  Therefore, it was felt appropriate to take the patient for a diagnostic laparoscopy with a possible oophorectomy.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the operating room where general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was placed in dorsal lithotomy position with the use of Allis strips and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter and she was examined under anesthesia and was noted to have the findings as above.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's vagina with excellent visualization of the cervix.  The cervix was grasped at 12 o'clock position with a single-toothed tenaculum and pulled into the operative field.  The uterus was then sounded to approximately 3.5 inches and then a uterine elevator was placed.  The vulsellum tenaculum was removed.  The weighted speculum was removed.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen where 1 cm infraumbilical incision was made in the infraumbilical fold.  The Veress step needle was then placed into the abdomen while the abdomen was being tented up with towel clamp.  The CO2 was then turned on with unoccluded flow and excellent pressures.  This was continued till a normal symmetrical pneumoperitoneum was obtained.  Then, a #11 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed into the infraumbilical port without any difficulty and placement was confirmed by laparoscope.  Laparoscopic findings are as noted above.  A suprapubic incision was made with the knife and then a #12 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed in the suprapubic region under direct visualization.  Then, a grasper was used to untorse the ovary.  Then, a #12 mm port was placed in the right flank region under direct visualization using a LigaSure vessel sealing system.  The right tube and ovary were amputated and noted to be hemostatic.  The EndoCatch bag was then placed through the suprapubic port and the ovary was placed into the bag.  The ovary was too large to fit completely into the bag.  Therefore, a laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was used to aspirate the contents of the ovary while it was still inside the bag.,There was approximately 200 cc of fluid aspirated from the cyst.  This was a clear yellow fluid.  Then, the bag was closed and the ovary was removed from the suprapubic port.  The suprapubic port did have to be extended somewhat to allow for the removal of the ovary.  The trocar and sleeve were then placed back into the port.  The abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline using the Nezhat-Dorsey suction irrigator and the incision site was noted to be hemostatic.  The pelvis was clear and clean.  ,Pictures were obtained.  The suprapubic port was then removed under direct visualization and then using a #0-vicyrl and UR6.  Two figure-of-eight sutures were placed in the fascia of suprapubic port and fascia was closed and the pneumoperitoneum was maintained after the sutures were placed.  Therefore, the peritoneal surface was noted to be hemostatic.  Therefore, the camera was removed.  All instruments were removed.  The abdomen was allowed to completely deflate and then the trocars were placed back through the sleeves of the right flank #12 port and the infraumbilical port and these were removed.  The infraumbilical port was examined and noted to have a small fascial defect which was repaired with #0-Vicryl and UR6.  The right flank area was palpated and there was no facial defect noted.

She has been using her inhaler daily.  Her allergies seem to be a little bit worse as well.  Her husband has been hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things.  She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.  She has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past.  She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal irritation with that.,She had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle.  She has been more impatient around that time.  Says otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month.  It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual cycle starts.  Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past.  Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats with this.  In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract infection previously.  Her urine has not been rechecked.

After reviewing the risks and benefits, the patient was deemed in satisfactory condition to undergo the procedure.  The anesthesia plan was to use conscious sedation.  Immediately prior to administration of medications, the patient was re-assessed for adequacy to receive sedatives.  The heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, blood pressure, adequacy of pulmonary ventilation, and response to care were monitored throughout the procedure.  The physical status of the patient was re-assessed after the procedure.  After I obtained informed consent, the scope was passed under direct vision.

4077,"BLEPHAROPLASTY,The patient was prepped and draped.  The upper lid skin was marked out in a lazy S fashion, and the redundant skin marked out with a Green forceps.  Then the upper lids were injected with 2% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine and 1 mL of Wydase per 20 mL of solution.,The upper lid skin was then excised within the markings.  Gentle pressure was placed on the upper eyelids, and the fat in each of the compartments was teased out using a scissor and cotton applicator; and then the fat was cross clamped, cut, and the clamp cauterized.  This was done in the all compartments of the middle and medial compartments of the upper eyelid, and then the skin sutured with interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures.  The first suture was placed in the lower eyelid skin picking up the periorbital muscle and then the upper portion of the tarsus and then the upper lid skin.  This created a significant crisp, supratarsal fold.  The upper lid skin was closed in this fashion, and then attention was turned to the lower lid.,An incision was made under the lash line and slightly onto the lateral canthus.  The #15 blade was used to delineate the plane in the lateral portion of the incision, and then using a scissor the skin was cut at the marking.  Then the skin muscle flap was elevated with sharp dissection.  The fat was located and using a scissor the three eyelid compartments were opened.  Fat was teased out, cross clamped, the fat removed, and then the clamp cauterized.  Once this was done the skin was tailored to the lower lid incision site with mouth open and eyes in upward gaze, and then the excess skin removed.  The suture line was sutured with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures.  Once this was done the procedure was finished.,The patient left the OR in satisfactory condition.

Open laparoscopy.,3.  Fulguration of endometrial implant.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 21-year-old single female with chronic recurrent pelvic pain unresponsive to both estrogen and progesterone-containing birth control pills, either cyclically or daily as well as progestational medication only, who had a negative GI workup recently including colonoscopy, and desired definitive operative evaluation and diagnosis prior to initiation of a 6-month course of Depo-Lupron.,PROCEDURE: , After an adequate plane of general anesthesia had been obtained, the patient was placed in a dorsal lithotomy position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for pelviolabdominal surgery.  Bimanual examination revealed a mid position normal-sized uterus with benign adnexal area.,In the high lithotomy position, a weighted speculum was placed into the posterior vaginal wall.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a single-tooth tenaculum.  A Hulka tenaculum was placed transcervically.  The other instruments were removed.  A Foley catheter was placed transurethrally to drain the bladder intraoperatively.,In the low lithotomy position and in steep Trendelenburg, attention was turned to the infraumbilical region.  Here, a stab wound incision was made through which the 120 mm Veress needle was placed and approximately 3 L of carbon dioxide used to create a pneumoperitoneum.  The needle was removed, the incision minimally enlarged, and the #5 trocar and cannula were placed.  The trocar was removed and the scope placed confirming a preperitoneal insufflation.,The space was drained off the insufflated gas and 2 more attempts were made, which failed due to the patient's adiposity.  Attention was turned back to the vaginal area where in the high lithotomy position, attempts were made at a posterior vaginal apical insertion.  The Hulka tenaculum was removed, the posterior lip of the cervix grasped with a single-tooth tenaculum, and the long Allis clamp used to grasp the posterior fornix on which was placed traction.  The first short and subsequently 15 cm Veress needles were attempted to be placed, but after several passes, no good pneumoperitoneum could be established via this route also.  It was elected not to do a transcervical intentional uterine perforation, but to return to the umbilical area.  The 15 cm Veress needle was inserted several times, but again a pneumo was preperitoneal.,Finally, an open laparoscopic approach was undertaken.  The skin incision was expanded with a knife blade.  Blunt dissection was used to carry the dissection down to the fascia.  This was grasped with Kocher clamps, entered sharply and opened transversely.  Four 0 Vicryl sutures were placed as stay sutures and tagged with hemostats and needles were cutoff.  Dissection continued between the rectus muscle and finally the anterior peritoneum was reached, grasped, elevated, and entered.,At this juncture, the Hasson cannula was placed and tied snugly with the above stay sutures while the pneumoperitoneum was being created, a #10 scope was placed confirming the intraperitoneal positioning.,Under direct visualization, a suprapubic 5 mm cannula and manipulative probe were placed.  Clockwise inspection of the pelvis revealed a benign vesicouterine pouch, normal uterus and fundus, normal right tube and ovary.  In the cul-de-sac, there were 3 clusters of 3 to 5 carbon charred type endometrial implants and those more distally in the greatest depth had created puckering and tenting.  The left tube and ovary were normal.  There were no adhesions.  There was no evidence of acute pelvic inflammatory disease.,The Endoshears and subsequently cautery on a hook were placed and the implants fulgurated.  Pictures were taken for confirmation both before and after the burn.,The carbon chars were irrigated and aspirated.  The smoke plume was removed without difficulty.  Approximately 50 mL of irrigant was left in the pelvis.  Due to the difficulty in placing and maintaining the Hasson cannula, no attempts were made to view the upper abdominal quadrant, specifically the liver and gallbladder.,The suprapubic cannula was removed under direct visualization, the pneumo released, the scope removed, the stay sutures cut, and the Hasson cannula removed.  The residual sutures were then tied together to completely occlude the fascial opening so that there will be no future hernia at this site.  Finally, the skin incisions were approximated with 3-0 Dexon subcuticularly.  They had been preincisionally injected with bupivacaine to which the patient said she had no known allergies.  The vaginal instruments were removed.  All counts were correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",Surgery

The FDS had a partial ulnar slip laceration and the FDP had a 25% transverse laceration as well.  The radial neurovascular bundle was found to be completely intact.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  All bony prominences were adequately padded.  Tourniquet was placed on the right upper extremity after being packed with Webril, but not inflated at this time.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The hand was inspected.  Palmar surface revealed approximally 0.5 cm laceration at the base of the right ring finger at the base of proximal phalanx, which was approximated with nylon suture.  The sutures were removed and the wound was explored.  It was found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was 100% transected.  The radial neurovascular bundle on the right ring finger was found to be completely intact.  We explored the flexor tendon and found that there was a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the FDS and a 25% laceration in a transverse fashion to the FDP.  We copiously irrigated the wound.  Repair was undertaken of the FDS with #3-0 undyed Ethibond suture.  The laceration of the FDP was not felt that it need to repair due to majority of the substance in the FDP was still intact.  Attention during our repair at the flexor tendon, the A1 pulley was incised for better visualization as well as better tendon excursion after repair.  Attention was then drawn to the ulnar digital bundle which has been transected prior during the injury.  The digital nerve was dissected proximally and distally to likely visualize the nerve.  The nerve was then approximated using microvascular technique with #8-0 nylon suture.  The hands were well approximated.  The nerve was not under undue tension.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress alternating with simple suture.  Sterile dressing was placed and a dorsal extension Box splint was placed.  The patient was transferred off of the bed and placed back on a gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.

Left ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow (354.2).,OPERATIONS PERFORMED:,1.  Left carpal tunnel release (64721).,2.  Left ulnar nerve anterior submuscular transposition at the elbow (64718).,3.  Lengthening of the flexor pronator muscle mass in the proximal forearm to accommodate the submuscular position of the ulnar nerve (25280).,ANESTHESIA: , General anesthesia with intubation.,INDICATIONS OF PROCEDURE: , This patient is insulin-dependant diabetic.  He is also has end-stage renal failure and has chronic hemodialysis.  Additionally, the patient has had prior heart transplantation.  He has been evaluated for ischemic problems to both lower extremities and also potentially to the left upper extremity.  However, it is our contention that this patient's prime problem of the left upper extremity is probably neuropathic ulcers from total lack of sensation along the ulnar border of the left little finger.  These started initially as unrecognized paper cuts.  Additionally, the patient appears to have a neurogenic pain affecting predominantly the areas innovated by the median nerve, but also to the little finger.  Finally, this patient does indeed have occlusive arterial disease to the left upper extremity in that he has a short segment radial artery occlusion and he does appear to have a narrowed segment in the ulnar artery, but the arteriogram shows distal perfusion down the ulnar border of the hand and into the little finger.  Thus, we have planned to proceed first with nerve entrapment releases and potentially at the later date do arterial reconstruction if deemed necessary.  Thirdly, this patient does have chronic distal ischemic problems with evidence of ""ping-pong ball sign"" due to fat atrophy at the finger tips and some periodic cracking and ulceration at the tips of the fingers.  However, this patient has no clinical sign at all of tissue necrosis at the finger tips at this time.,The patient has also previously had an arteriovenous shunt in the forearm, which has been deactivated within the last 3 weeks.  Thus, we planned to bring this patient to the operating room for left carpal tunnel release as well as anterior submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve.  This patient had electro diagnostic studies performed, which showed severe involvement of both the ulnar nerve at the elbow and the medial nerve at the carpal tunnel.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After general anesthesia being induced and the patient intubated, he is given intravenous Ancef.  The entire left upper extremity is prepped with Betadine all the way to the axilla and draped in a sterile fashion.  A sterile tourniquet and webril are placed higher on the arm.  The arm is then exsanguinated with Ace bandage and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.  I started first at the carpal tunnel release and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made parallel to the thenar crease and stopping short of the wrist flexion crease.  Dissection continued through subcutaneous tissue to the palmer aponeurosis, which is divided longitudinally from distal to proximal.  I next encountered the transverse carpal ligament, which in turn is also divided longitudinally from distal to proximal, and the proximal most division of the transverse carpal ligament is done under direct vision into the distal forearm.  Having confirmed a complete release of the transverse carpal ligament, I next evaluated the contents of the carpal tunnel.  The synovium was somewhat thickened, but not unduly so.  There was some erythema along the length of the median nerve, indicating chronic compression.  The motor branch of the median nerve was clearly identified.  The contents of the carpal canal were retracted in a radial direction and the floor of the canal evaluated and no other extrinsic compressive pathology was identified.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and wound edges were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 nylon sutures.,I next turned my attention to the cubital tunnel problem and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made on the medial aspect of the arm extending into the forearm with the incision passing directly between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle.  Dissection continues through fascia and then skin clamps are elevated to the level of the fascia on the flexor pronator muscle mass.  In the process of elevating this skin flap I elevated and deactivated shunt together with the skin flap.  I now gained access to the radial border of the flexor pronator muscle mass, dissected down the radial side, until I identified the median nerve.,I turned my attention back to the ulnar nerve and it is located immediately posterior to the medial intramuscular septum in the upper arm, and I dissected it all the way proximally until I encountered the location with ulnar the nerve passed from the anterior to the posterior compartments in the upper portion of the arm.  The entire medial intramuscular septum is now excised.  The ulnar nerve is mobilized between vessel loops and includes with it is accompanying vascular structures.  Larger penetrating vascular tributaries to the muscle ligated between hemoclips.  I continued to mobilize the nerve around the medial epicondyle and then took down the aponeurosis between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris and continued to dissect the nerve between the FCU muscle fibers.  The nerve is now mobilized and I had retained the large muscular branches and dissected them out into the muscle and also proximally using microvascular surgical techniques.  In this way, the nerve was able to be mobilized between vessiloops and easily transposed anterior to the flexor pronator muscle mass in tension free manner.,I now made an oblique division of the entire flexor pronator muscle mass proximally in the forearm and the ulnar nerve was able to be transposed deep to the muscle in a nonkinking and tension-free manner.  Because of the oblique incision into the flexor pronator muscle mass the muscle edges were now able to slide on each other.  So that in effect a lengthening is performed.  Fascial repair is done with interrupted figure-of-eight 0-Ethibond sutures.  I now ranged the arm through the full range of flexion and extension at the elbow and there was no significant kinking on the nerve and there was a tension-free coverage of the muscle without any impingement on the nerve.  The entire arm is next wrapped with a Kerlix wrap and I released the tourniquet and after allowing the reactive hyperemia to subside, I then unwrap the arm and check for hemostasis.  Wound is copiously irrigated with normal saline and then a 15-French Round Blake drainage placed through a separate stab incision and laid along the length of the wound.  A layered wound closure is done with interrupted Vicryl subcutaneously, and a running subcuticular Monocryl to the skin.  A 0.25% plain Marcaine then used to infiltrate all the wound edges to help with post operative analgesia and dressings take the form of Adaptic impregnated Bacitracin ointment, followed by a well-fluffed gauze and a Kerlix dressing and confirming Kerlix and webril, and an above elbow sugar-tong splint is applied extending to the support of the wrist.  Fingers and femoral were free to move.  The splint is well padded with webril and is in turn held in place with Kerlix and Ace bandage.  Meanwhile the patient is awakened and extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in good condition.  Sponge and needle counts reported as correct at the end of the procedure.",Orthopedic

The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen.  The mucosa throughout the colon and in the terminal ileum was normal, with no evidence of colitis.  Special attention was paid to the rectum, including retroflexed views of the distal rectum and the anorectal junction.  There was no evidence of either inflammation or a fistulous opening.  The scope was withdrawn.  A careful exam of the anal canal and perianal area demonstrated a jagged 8-mm opening at the anorectal junction posteriorly (12 o'clock position).  Some purulent material could be expressed through the opening.  There was no suggestion of significant perianal reservoir of inflamed tissue or undrained material.  Specifically, the posterior wall of the distal rectum and anal canal were soft and unremarkable.  In addition, scars were noted in the perianal area.  The first was a small dimpled scar, 1 cm from the anal verge in the 11 o'clock position.  The second was a dimpled scar about 5 cm from the anal verge on the left buttock's cheek.  There were no other abnormalities noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Normal colonoscopy to the terminal ileum.,2.

497,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,Open reduction and internal fixation, high grade Frykman VIII distal radius fracture.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,PREOPERATIVE INDICATIONS: , This is a 52-year-old patient of mine who I have repaired both shoulder rotator cuffs, the most recent one in the calendar year 2007.  While he was climbing a ladder recently in the immediate postop stage, he fell suffering the aforementioned heavily comminuted Frykman fracture.  This fracture had a fragment that extended in the distal radial ulnar joint, a die-punch fragment in the center of the radius.  The ulnar styloid and the radial styloid were off and there were severe dorsal comminutions.  He presented to my office the morning of April 3, 2007, having had a left reduction done elsewhere a day ago.  The reduction, although adequate, had allowed for the fragments to settle and I discussed with him the severity of the injury on a scale of 1-8, this was essentially an 8.  The best results have been either with external fixation or internal fixation, most recently volar plating of a locking variety has been popular, and I felt that this would be appropriate in his case.,Risks and benefits otherwise described were bleeding, infection, need to do operative revise or removal of hardware.  He is taking a job out of state in the next couple of months.  Hence I felt that even with close followup, this is a particularly difficult fracture as far as the morbidity of the injury proceeds.,OPERATIVE NOTE: , After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, one gram of Ancef was given intravenously.  The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in supine position with the left hand in the arm table, magnification was used throughout.  The time out procedure was done to the satisfaction of all present that this was indeed the appropriate extremity on the appropriate patient.  A small C-arm was brought in to help guide the incision which was a volar curvilinear incision that included as part of this due to the fracture blisters eminent compartment syndrome and numbness in fingers.  A carpal tunnel release was done with the transverse carpal ligament being protected with a Freer elevator.  The usual amount of dissection of the pronator quadratus was necessary to view the distal radial fragment.  The pronator quadratus actually grasped several of the fragments itself which had to be dissected free from them, specifically the distal radial ulnar joint and die-punch fragment.  At this point, a locking Synthes distal radius plate from the modular handset was selected that had five articular screws as well as five locking shaft screws.  The ulnar styloid was not affixed in any portion of this repair.  The plate was viewed under the image intensification device, i.e., x-ray and the screws were placed in this order.  The most proximal shaft screw was placed to allow the remainder of the plate to form a buttress to then rearrange the fragments around the locking screws and a locking plate having been selected from the volar approach, a locking 12-mm screw through 16-mm screws were placed in the following order.  Most proximal on the radial shaft of the plate, then the radial styloid, i.e., the most distal and lateral screw, the next most proximal shaft screw followed by the distal radial ulnar joint screw.  Three screws were locking across the die-punch fragment.  The remaining two screws were placed into the radial shaft.  All of these were locking screws of 2 mm in diameter and as the construct was created, the relative motion of the intra-articular fragment in dorsal comminution all diminished greatly, although the exposure as well as the amount of reduction force used was substantial.  The tourniquet time was 1.5 hours.  At this point, the tourniquet was let down.  The entire construct was irrigated with copious amounts of bacitracin and normal saline.  Closure was affected with 0 Vicryl underneath the skin surface followed by 3-0 Prolene in interrupted sutures in the volar wound.  Several image intensification x-rays were taken at the conclusion of the case to check screw length.  Screw lengths were changed out during the case as needed based on the x-ray findings.  The wound was injected with Marcaine, lidocaine, Depo-Medrol, and Kantrex.  A very heavily padded fluffy cotton Jones-type dressing was applied with a volar splint.  Estimated blood loss was 10 mL.  There were no specimens.  Tourniquet time was 1.5 hours.",Surgery

He has a left nasal obstruction and depressed left nasal bone.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was given general endotracheal anesthesia and monitored with pulse oximetry, EKG, and CO2 monitors.,The face was prepped with Betadine soap and solution and draped in a sterile fashion.  Nasal mucosa was decongested using Afrin pledgets as well as 1% Xylocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into bilateral nasal septal mucoperichondrium and the nasal dorsum, lateral osteotomy sites.,Inspection revealed caudal portion of the cartilaginous septum lying crosswise across the nasal spine area and columella causing obstruction of the left nasal valve.  Further up, the cartilaginous septum was displaced to the left of the maxillary crest.  There was a large maxillary crest and supramaxillary crest had a large spur with the vomer bone touching the inferior turbinate.,There was a large deep groove horizontally on the right side corresponding to the left maxillary crest.,A left hemitransfixion incision was made.  Mucoperichondrium was elevated from left side of the cartilaginous septum and mucoperiosteum was elevated from the ethmoid plate.  Vomer and inferior tunnel was created at the floor of the left side of the nose to connect the anterior and inferior tunnels, which was rather difficult at the area of the vomerine spur, which was very sharp and touching the inferior turbinate.,The caudal cartilaginous septum, which was lying crosswise, was separated from the main cartilage leaving approximately 1 cm strut.  The right side mucoperichondrium was released from the cartilaginous septum as well as ethmoid plate and the maxillary crest area.,The caudal cartilaginous strut was sutured to the columella with interrupted #4-0 chromic catgut suture to bring it into the midline.,Further back, the cartilaginous septum anterior to the ethmoid plate was deviated to the left side, so it was freed from the maxillary crest, nasal dorsum, from the ethmoid plate, and was sutured in the midline with a transfixion #4-0 plain catgut sutures.,Further posteriorly, the ethmoid plate was deviated to the left side and portion of it was removed with Jansen-Middleton punch forceps.,The main deviation was also caused by the vomerine crest and the maxillary crest and supramaxillary cartilaginous cartilage.,This area was freed from the perichondrium on both sides.  The maxillary crest was removed with a gouge.  Vomer was partially removed with a gouge and the rest of the vomer was displaced back into the midline.,Thus, the deviated septum was corrected.  Left hemitransfixion incisions were closed with interrupted #4-0 chromic catgut sutures.  The septum was also filtered with #4-0 plain catgut sutures.,By valve, septal splints were tied to the septum bilaterally with a transfixion #5-0 nylon suture.,Next, the nasal bone suture deviated to the left side were corrected.  The right nasal bone was depressed and left nasal bone was wide.  Therefore, the nasal bones were refractured back into the midline by compressing the left nasal bone and elevating the right nasal bone with the nasal bone elevator through the nasal cavities.  The left intercartilaginous incision was made and the nasal bones were disimpacted subperiosteally and they were molded back into the midline.,Steri-Strips were applied to the nasal dorsal skin and a Denver type of splint was applied to the nasal dorsal to stabilize the nasal bones.,Nasal cavities were packed with Telfa gauze rolled on both sides with bacitracin ointment.  Approximate blood loss was 10 to 20 mL.",Surgery

It is not associated with movement, but occasionally the pain was so bad that it was associated with vomiting.  She has tried LactAid, which initially helped, but then the pain returned.  She has tried changing her diet and Pepcid AC.  She was seen at XYZ where blood work was done.  At that time, she had a normal white count and a normal H&H.  She was given muscle relaxants, which did not work.,Approximately two weeks ago, she was seen in the emergency room at XYZ where a pelvic ultrasound was done.

She denies constipation and diarrhea.  She has had some hot flashes, but has not taken her temperature.,In addition, she states that her periods have been very irregular coming between four and six weeks.  They are associated with cramping which she is not happy about.,She has never had a pelvic exam.  She states she is not sexually active and declined having her mother leave the room, so she was not questioned regarding this without her mother present.

I expressed my doubt that her pain was secondary to this 1.9-cm ovarian cyst given the fact that there was no free fluid surrounding this.  However, given that she has irregular periods and they are painful for her, I think it is reasonable to start her on a low-dose birth control pill.  She has no personal or familial contraindications to start this.  She was given a prescription for Lo/Ovral, dispensed 30 with refill x 4.

She has been anemic as well with no gross evidence of blood loss.  She has had a decreased appetite with weight loss greater than 20 lb over the past few months.  After discussion with the patient and her daughter, she was scheduled for EGD and colonoscopy for evaluation.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation.  When adequate level of sedation was achieved, a digital rectal exam was performed, which demonstrated no masses and no hemorrhoids.  The colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and air was insufflated.  The scope was coursed through the rectum and sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon to the level of the cecum.  There were no polyps, masses, diverticuli, or areas of inflammation.  The scope was then slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls.  Air was aspirated.  Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed.  There was no evidence of perianal disease.  No source of the anemia was identified.,Attention was then taken for performing an EGD.  The gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and was entered into the hypopharynx.  The esophagus was easily intubated and traversed.  There were no abnormalities of the esophagus.  The stomach was entered and was insufflated.  The scope was coursed along the greater curvature towards the antrum.  Adjacent to the pylorus, towards the anterior surface, was a mass like lesion with a central _______.  It was not clear if this represents a healing ulcer or neoplasm.  Several biopsies were taken.  The mass was soft.  The pylorus was then entered.  The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, or bleeding.  The scope was then brought back into the antrum and was retroflexed.  In the fundus and body, there was evidence of streaking and inflammation.  There were also several small sessile polyps, which were removed with biopsy forceps.  Biopsy was also taken for CLO.  A hiatal hernia was present as well.  Air was aspirated.

General inhalational anesthesia was administered through the patient's existing 4.0 endotracheal tube.  The neck was extended and secured with tape and incision in the midline of the neck approximately 2 fingerbreadths above the sternal notch was outlined.  The incision measured approximately 1 cm and was just below the palpable cricoid cartilage and first tracheal ring.  The incision area was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000.  A #67 blade was used to perform the incision.  Electrocautery was used to remove excess fat tissue to expose the strap muscles.  The strap muscles were grasped and divided in the midline with a cutting electrocautery.  Sharp dissection was used to expose the anterior trachea and cricoid cartilage.  The thyroid isthmus was identified crossing just below the cricoid cartilage.  This was divided in the midline with electrocautery.  Blunt dissection was used to expose adequate cartilaginous rings.  A 4.0 silk was used for stay sutures to the midline of the cricoid.  Additional stay sutures were placed on each side of the third tracheal ring.  Thin DuoDerm was placed around the stoma.  The tracheal incision was performed with a #11 blade through the second, third, and fourth tracheal rings.  The cartilaginous edges were secured to the skin edges with interrupted #4-0 Monocryl.

The plan is for repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  IV antibiotics were given.  He was then placed in the supine position.  The foreskin was retracted and cleansed.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  A stay stitch of 4-0 Prolene was then placed on the glans.  The urethra was calibrated with the lacrimal duct probes to an 8-French.  We then marked out the coronal cuff, the penile shaft skin as well as the glanular plate for future surgery with a marking pen.,We then used a 15-blade knife to circumscribe the penis around the coronal cuff.  We then degloved the penis using the curved tenotomy scissors, and electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The patient had some splaying of the spongiosum tissue, which was also incised laterally and rotated to make a secondary flap.  Once the penis was degloved, and the excessive chordee tissue was released, we then placed a vessel loop tourniquet around the base of the penis and using IV grade saline injected the penis for an artifical erection.  He was still noted to have chordee, so a midline incision through the Buck fascia was made with a 15-blade knife and Heineke-Mikulicz closure using 5-0 Prolene was then used for the chordee Nesbit tuck.  We repeated the artificial erection and the penis was straight.  We then incised the urethral plate with an ophthalmic blade in the midline, and then elevated the glanular wings using a 15-blade knife to elevate and then incise them.  Using the curved iris scissors, we then also further mobilized the glanular wings.  The 8-French Zaontz was then placed while the tourniquet was still in place into the urethral plate.  The upper aspect of the distal meatus was then closed with an interrupted suture of 7-0 Vicryl, and then using a running subcuticular closure, we closed the urethral plates over the Zaontz catheter.  We then mobilized subcutaneous tissue from the penile shaft skin, and the inner perpetual skin on the dorsum, and then buttonholed the flap, placed it over the head of the penis, and then, used it to cover of the hypospadias repair with tacking sutures of 7-0 Vicryl.  We then rolled the spongiosum flap to cover the distal urethra that was also somewhat dysplastic; 7-0 Vicryl was used for that as well.  5-0 Vicryl was used to roll the glans with 2 deep sutures, and then, horizontal mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to reconstitute the glans.  Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to approximate the urethral meatus to the glans.  Once this was done, we then excised the excessive penile shaft skin, and used the interrupted sutures of 6-0 chromic to attach the penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff.  On the ventrum itself, we used horizontal mattress sutures to close the defect.,At the end of the procedure, the Zaontz catheter was sutured into place with a 4-0 Prolene suture, Dermabond tissue adhesive, and Surgicel was used as a dressing and a second layer of Telfa and clear eye tape was then used to tape it into place.  IV Toradol was given at the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in a stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.",Urology

There is a twin gestation in the vertex transverse lie with an anterior placenta and a normal amount of amniotic fluid surrounding both of the twins.  The fetal biometry of twin A is as follows.  The biparietal diameter is 4.9 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, head circumference 17.6 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 1 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, and femur length is 3.1 cm consistent with 19 weeks and 5 days, and the humeral length is 3.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day.  The average gestational age by ultrasound is 20 weeks and 1 day and the estimated fetal weight is 353 g.  The following structures are seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey, the shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels and the placenta.,Limited in views of baby A with a nasolabial region.,The following is the fetal biometry for twin B. The biparietal diameter is 4.7 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, head circumference 17.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, the femur length is 3.3 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 3 days, and the humeral length is 3.1 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, the average gestational age by ultrasound is 22 weeks and 2 days, and the estimated fetal weight is 384 g.  The following structures were seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey.  The shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels, and the placenta.  Limited on today's ultrasound the views of nasolabial region.,In summary, this is a twin gestation, which may well be monochorionic at 20 weeks and 1 day.  There is like gender and a single placenta.  One cannot determine with certainty whether or not this is a monochorionic or dichorionic gestation from the ultrasound today.,I sat with the patient and her husband and discussed alternative findings and the complications.  We focused our discussion today on the association of twin pregnancy with preterm delivery.  We discussed the fact that the average single intrauterine pregnancy delivers at 40 weeks' gestation while the average twin delivery occurs at 35 weeks' gestation.  We discussed the fact that 15% of twins deliver prior to 32 weeks' gestation.  These are the twins which we have the most concern regarding the long-term prospects of prematurity.  We discussed several etiologies of preterm delivery including preterm labor, incompetent cervix, premature rupture of the fetal membranes as well as early delivery from preeclampsia and growth restriction.  We discussed the use of serial transvaginal ultrasound to assess for early cervical change and the use of serial transabdominal ultrasound to assess for normal interval growth.  We discussed the need for frequent office visits to screen for preeclampsia.  We also discussed treatment options such as cervical cerclage, bedrest, tocolytic medications, and antenatal steroids.  I would recommend that the patient return in two weeks for further cervical assessment and assessment of fetal growth and well-being.,In closing, I do want to thank you very much for involving me in the care of your delightful patient.  I did review all of the above findings and recommendations with the patient today at the time of her visit.

Her last colonoscopy was in 2002, and at that time she was told it was essentially normal.  Nonetheless, she has a strong family history of colon cancer, and it has been almost four to five years so she wants to have a repeat colonoscopy.  I told her that the interval was appropriate and that it made sense to do so.  She denies any significant weight change that she cannot explain.  She has had no hematochezia.  She denies any melena.  She says she has had no real change in her bowel habit but occasionally does have thin stools.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  On today's visit we reviewed her entire health history.  Surgically she has had a stomach operation for ulcer disease back in 1974, she says.  She does not know exactly what was done.  It was done at a hospital in California which she says no longer exists.  This makes it difficult to find out exactly what she had done.  She also had her gallbladder and appendix taken out in the 1970s at the same hospital.  Medically she has no significant problems and no true medical illnesses.  She does suffer from some mild gastroparesis, she says.,MEDICATIONS: , Reglan 10 mg once a day.,ALLERGIES: , She denies any allergies to medications but is sensitive to medications that cause her to have ulcers, she says.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She still smokes one pack of cigarettes a day.

She has no lymphadenopathy in the head and neck, supraclavicular, or axillary spaces bilaterally.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rubs, or rhonchi.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub, or gallop.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.,EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, with good pulses in the radial arteries bilaterally.,NEURO:  No focal deficits, is intact to soft touch in all four.,ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: , In light of her history and physical, clearly the patient would be well served with an upper and lower endoscopy.  We do not know what the anatomy is, and if she did have an antrectomy, she needs to be checked for marginal ulcers.  She also complains of significant reflux and has not had an upper endoscopy in over five to six years as well.  I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives to upper and lower endoscopy, and these include over sedation, perforation, and dehydration, and she wants to proceed.,We will schedule her for an upper and lower endoscopy at her convenience.",Gastroenterology

These were representing on the order of 50% or more of the circumference of her lower leg.  They were in a distribution to be consistent with stasis ulcers.  They were granulating nicely and she was scheduled for surgery.,FINDINGS:,  Large ulcers of lower extremities with size as described above.  These are irregular in shape and posterior and laterally on the lower legs.  There was no evidence of infection.  The ultimate skin grafting was quite satisfactory.,PROCEDURE: , Having obtained adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped from the pubis to the toes.  The legs were examined and the wounds were Pulsavaced bilaterally with 3 liters of saline with Bacitracin.  The wounds were then inspected and there was adequate hemostasis and there was only minimal fibrinous debris that needed to be removed.  Once this was accomplished, the skin was harvested from the right thigh at approximately 0.013 inch.  This was meshed 1:1.5 and then stapled into position on the wounds.  The wounds were then dressed with a fine mesh gauze that was stapled into position as well as Kerlix soaked in Sulfamylon solution.,She was then dressed in additional Kerlix, followed by Webril, and splints were fashioned in a spiral fashion that avoided foot drop and stabilized them, and at the same time did not put pressure across the heels.

Laparoscopically, the patient has massive pelvic adhesions with completely obliterated posterior cul-de-sac and adnexa.,No adnexal structures were initially able to be visualized until after the lysis of adhesions.  Eventually we found a normal appearing right ovary, severely scarred right and left fallopian tubes, and a enlarged complex cystic left ovary.  There was a normal-appearing appendix and liver, and the vesicouterine junction appeared within normal limits.  There were significant adhesions from the small bowel to the bilateral adnexa in the posterior surface of the uterus.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where a general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  Next, a weighted speculum was placed in the vagina and anterior wall of the vagina was elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was then sounded to 12 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size #20 Hank.  Next a Telfa pad was placed on the weighted speculum and a short curettage was performed obtaining a large amount of endometrial tissue.  Next, the uterine manipulator was placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix.  At this point, the vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed.  Next, attention was turned to the abdomen where an approximately 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to the umbilicus.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp and Veress needle was inserted through this incision.  Small amount of normal saline was injected into Veress needle and seemed to drop freely.  So, the Veress needle was connected to he CO2 gas, which was started at the lower setting.  It was seen to flow freely with a normal resistance so the gas was advanced to the higher setting.  The abdomen was then insufflated to an adequate distention.  Next, the Veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was inserted.  Next, the introducer was removed from the trocar and the laparoscope was inserted through this port and the port was also connected to the CO2 gas.  At this point, the initial operative findings were seen.  Next, a size #5 step trocar was inserted approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis in the midline.  This was done by making a 1 cm incision with the skin knife, introducing a Veress needle with Ethicon sheet, and the Veress needle was then removed and the #5 port was introduced under direct visualization.  A size #5 port was also placed approximately six fingerbreadths to the right of the umbilicus in a similar manner also under direct visualization.  A blunt probe was inserted suprapubically along with a grasper in the right upper quadrant.  These were used to see the above operative findings.  Next, a size #12 mm port was introduced approximately seven fingerbreadths to the left of the umbilicus under direct visualization.  Through this, a Harmonic scalpel was inserted.,The Harmonic scalpel along with the grasper was used to meticulously address the adhesions along the right adnexa in the posterior cul-de-sac.  Care was taken at all times to avoid the bowel and the ureters.  The fallopian tubes appeared massively scarred and completely obliterated from disease.  After the right adnexa had been freed to the point where we could visualize the ovary and the posterior cul-de-sac was clearing off then we could visualize the uterosacral ligaments.  Attention was turned to the left adnexa, which appeared to contain a cystic structure, but it was unclear at the beginning of the procedure what the structure was.  Adhesions were carefully taken down from the bowel to the left fallopian tube and ovary, and sidewall.  The adhesions were then carefully removed from the inferior aspect of the ovary also with the Harmonic scalpel.  At intermittent points throughout the procedure, the suction irrigator was used to irrigate and suck blood and irrigation out of the pelvis to watch for any bleeding.  At this point, the Harmonic scalpel was removed and another laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was inserted and this was used to aspirate approximately 30 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the cystic structure.  Next, the needle was removed and the ligature device was inserted.  This was used to clamp across the fallopian tube initially and then after the fallopian tube was ligated, the uterovarian ligament was clamped and ligated with the ligature device.  Next, the fallopian tube was removed from the ovary with the ligature device in approximately 3 clamping and ligations.  Then, the attention was turned to the inferior aspect of the ovary.  First the infundibulopelvic ligament was identified, clamped with a ligature device, and ligated.  Next, the ovary was bluntly dissected from the ovarian fossa with attention to the left ureter.  Next, the ligature device was used to clamp and ligate the broad ligament immediately inferior to the ovary across.  Then the ovary was completely bluntly dissected out of the ovarian fossa and completely separated from the pelvis.  This was grasped with a clamp.  The ligature device was removed from the #12 and a EndoCatch bag was inserted to the size #12 port.  The left ovary was placed in this EndoCatch bag, which was then removed along with the whole port from the left upper quadrant.  Next, the pelvis was copiously irrigated and suctioned of all blood and extra fluid.  At this point, the remaining two size #5 ports were removed under direct visualization.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was desufflated.  Next, an introducer was replaced on a #11 port.  The #11 port was removed.  Next, the fascia in the left upper quadrant port was identified and grasped with Ochsner clamps, tented up, and closed with a single interrupted suture of #0 Vicryl on a UR-6 needle.  Next, all skin incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  The incisions were cleaned, injected with 0.25% Marcaine, and then adjusted with Steri-Strips and bandage appropriately.,The patient was taken from the operating room in stable condition and should be observed overnight in the hospital.",Surgery

Fentanyl 100 mcg.,4.  Benadryl 50 mg.,CLINICAL HISTORY: , The patient is a pleasant 57-year-old gentleman with a dilated cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction of 10%, been referred for AICD implantation because of his low ejection fraction and a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.  He has underlying sinus bradycardia.  Therefore, will likely be pacing much of the time and would benefit from a biventricular pacing device.,RISKS AND BENEFITS:,  Risks, benefits, and alternatives to implantation of biventricular AICD and defibrillation threshold testing were discussed with the patient.  Risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, vascular injury, cardiac perforation, stroke, myocardial infarction, the need for urgent cardiovascular surgery, and death were discussed with the patient.  The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the fasting state.  The region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 1% (20 mL) was administered to the area.  After achieving appropriate anesthesia, a percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was performed under fluoroscopy with two separate sticks.  Guidewires were advanced down into the left axillary vein.  Following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  Lidocaine 1% (10 mL) was administered to the medial aspect of the incision and a pocket was fashioned in the medial direction.  Using the more lateral of the guidewires, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  The dilator was removed and another wire was advanced down into the sheath.  The sheath was then backed up over the top of the two wires.  One wire was pinned to the drape and using the alternate wire, a 9-French side-arm sheath was advanced down into the left axillary vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  A defibrillation lead was then advanced down into the atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  The lead was then passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in the apical septal location.  The active fix screw was deployed.  Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  A 10-volt pacing was used temporarily and there was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  The suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  Using the wire that had been pinned to the drape, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced over this wire into the axillary vein.  The wire and dilator were removed.  An active pacing lead was then advanced down to the right atrium and the peel-away sheath was removed.  The lead was parked until a later time.  Using the separate access point, a 9-French side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  A curved outer sheath catheter as well as an inner catheter were advanced down into the area of the coronary sinus.  The coronary sinus was cannulated.  Inner catheter was removed and a balloon-tipped catheter was advanced into the coronary sinus.  A coronary sinus venogram was then performed.  It was noted that the most suitable location for lead placement was the middle cardiac vein.  This was cannulated and a passive lead was advanced over a Whisper EDS wire into a distal position.  Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  A 10-volt pacing was used temporarily.  There was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  The outer sheath was peeled away.  The 9 French sheath was then peeled away.  Suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  At this point, the atrial lead was then positioned in the right atrial appendage using a preformed J-curved stylet.  The lead body was turned several times and the lead was affixed to the tissue.  Adequate pacing and sensing function were established.  A suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  The pocket was then washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline.  Pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the leads.  The leads were carefully wrapped behind the pulse generator and the entire system was placed in the pocket.  The pocket was then closed with 2-0, 3-0, and 4-0 Vicryl using a running mattress stitch.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure and no acute complications were noted.,The patient was sedated further and shock on T was performed on two separate occasions.  The device was allowed to detect the charge and defibrillate, establishing the entire workings of the ICD system.,DEVICE DATA,1.

She started with some dizziness this morning and some left hand and left jaw numbness.  She said that she apparently had something about three weeks ago where she was dizzy and ended up falling down and she saw Dr. XYZ for that who gave her some Antivert.  She said that today though she woke up in the middle of the night and her left hand was numb and she was having numbness on the left side of her face, as well as the left side of her neck.  She said she had an earache a day or so ago.  She has not had any cold symptoms.,ALLERGIES:,  Demerol and codeine.,MEDICATIONS: , Lotensin, Lopid, metoprolol, and Darvocet.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  The patient says that she feels little bit nauseated at times.  She denies chest pain or shortness of breath and again feels like she has something in her throat.  She has been able to swallow liquids okay.

We are going to give her Valtrex 1 g t.i.d. for seven days and then if she starts noticing any other drooping or worsening of her symptoms on the left side of her face, she needs to come back, but I will not start her on steroids at this time, which she agreed with.",Neurology
636,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with attempted intraoperative cholangiogram.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 3 other trocars were placed.  The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position.  The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 3 cm above the anterior superior iliac spine.  The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.,The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left.  The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder.  A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free.,A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct close to the gallbladder.  The gallbladder was then grasped through the upper midline cannula and a fine-tipped scissors introduced through the third cannula and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct near the clips.  Several attempts at passing the cholangiocatheter into the ductotomy were made.  Despite numerous attempts at several angles, the cholangiocatheter could not be inserted into the cystic duct.  After several such attempts, and due to the fact that the anatomy was clear, we aborted any further attempts at cholangiography.  The distal cystic duct was doubly clipped.  The duct was divided between the clips.  The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct.  The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine.,The cystic artery was found medially and slightly posteriorly to the cystic duct.  It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues.  A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally.  The artery was divided between the clips.  The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine.,After the cystic duct and artery were transected, the gallbladder was dissected from the liver bed using Bovie electrocautery.  Prior to complete dissection of the gallbladder from the liver, the peritoneal cavity was copiously irrigated with saline and the operative field was examined for persistent blood or bile leaks of which there were none.,After the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula.  The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula.  As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen.  The neck of the gallbladder was then secured with a Kocher clamp, and the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen.,Following gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen.,Both midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture.  All skin incisions were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  Dressings were applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.",Surgery

88,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral undescended testes.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral undescended testes, bilateral intraabdominal testes.,PROCEDURE: , Examination under anesthesia and laparoscopic right orchiopexy.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 5 mL.,FLUIDS RECEIVED:  ,110 mL of crystalloid.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Atrophic bilateral testes, right is larger than left.  The left had atrophic or dysplastic vas and epididymis.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , No tubes or drains were used.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes.  Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable.  Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected.  We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-French feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage.  We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved Metzenbaum scissors.  Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens.  Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmHg.  We then evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted.  He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized.  The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring.  So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side.  Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas.  We then used the Maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised.  The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors.  We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring.  We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch.  Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation.  Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction.  Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic.  We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short.  The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent.  We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present.  We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 Monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two Monocryl stay sutures to close the fascial sheath, and then used 4-0 Rapide to close the skin defects, and then using Dermabond tissue adhesives, we covered all incisions.  At the end of the procedure, the right testis was well descended within the scrotum, and the feeding tube was removed.  The patient had IV Toradol and was in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.",Urology

3159,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Acute deep venous thrombosis, right lower extremity with bilateral pulmonary embolism, on intravenous heparin complicated with acute renal failure for evaluation.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,Briefly, this is a 36-year-old robust Caucasian gentleman with no significant past medical or surgical history, who works as a sales representative, doing a lot of traveling by plane and car and attending several sales shows, developed acute shortness of breath with an episode of syncope this weekend and was brought in by paramedics to Hospital.  A V/Q scan revealed multiple pulmonary perfusion defects consistent with high probability pulmonary embolism.  A Doppler venous study of the lower extremity also revealed nonocclusive right popliteal vein thrombosis.  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal-appearing liver, spleen, and pancreas; however, the right kidney appeared smaller compared to left and suggesting possibility of renal infarct.  Renal function on admission was within normal range; however, serial renal function showed rapid increase in creatinine to 5 today.  He has been on intravenous heparin and hemodialysis is being planned for tomorrow.  Reviewing his history, there is no family members with hypercoagulable state or prior history of any thrombotic complication.  He denies any recent injury to his lower extremity and in fact denied any calf pain or swelling.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:  ,Unremarkable.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He is married and has 1 son.

Liver profile normal.  Thyroid study revealed a TSH of 1.3.  Prothrombin time/INR 1.5, partial thromboplastin time 78.6 seconds.  Renal function, BUN 44 and creatinine 5.7.  Echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 65%, no intramural thrombus noted.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Bilateral pulmonary embolism, most consistent with emboli from right lower extremity, on intravenous heparin, rule out hereditary hypercoagulable state.,2.  Leukocytosis, most likely leukemoid reaction secondary to acute pulmonary embolism/renal infarction, doubt presence of myeloproliferative disorder.,3.  Acute renal failure secondary to embolic right renal infarction.,4.  Obesity.,PLAN: , From hematologic standpoint, we will await hypercoagulable studies, which have all been sent on admission to see if a hereditary component is at play.  For now, we will continue intravenous heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation with Coumadin.  In view of worsening renal function, may need temporary hemodialysis until renal function improves.

2804,"HISTORY: , Neurologic consultation was requested to assess and assist with her seizure medication.  The patient is a 3-year 3 months old girl with refractory epilepsy.  She had been previously followed by XYZ, but has been under the care of the UCSF epilepsy program and recently by Dr. Y.  I reviewed her pertinent previous neurology evaluations at CHCC and also interviewed mom.,The patient had seizure breakthrough in August 2007, which requires inpatient admission, Thanksgiving and then after that time had seizures every other day, up-to-date early December.  She remained seizure-free until 12/25/2007 when she had a breakthrough seizure at home treated with Diastat.  She presented to our ER today with prolonged convulsive seizure despite receiving 20 mg of Diastat at home.  Mom documented 103 temperature at home.  In the ER, this was 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.  I reviewed the ER notes.  At 0754 hours, she was having intermittent generalized tonic-clonic seizures despite receiving a total of 1.5 mg of lorazepam x5.  UCSF fellow was contacted.  She was given additional fosphenytoin and had a total dose of 15 mg/kg administered.  Vital weight was 27.  Seizures apparently had stopped.  The valproic acid level obtained at 0835 hours was 79.  According to mom, her last dose was at 6 p.m. and she did not receive her morning dose.  Other labs slightly showed leukocytosis with white blood cell count 21,000 and normal CMP.,Previous workup here showed an EEG on 2005, which showed a left posterior focus.  MRI on June 2007 and January 2005 were within normal limits.  Mom describes the following seizure types:,1.  Eye blinking with unresponsiveness.,2.  Staring off to one side.,3.  Focal motor activity in one arm and recently generalized tonic seizure.,She also said that she was supposed to see Dr. Y this Friday, but had postponed it to some subsequent time when results of genetic testing would be available.  She was being to physicians' care as Dr. Z had previously being following her last UCSF.,She had failed most of the first and second line anti-epileptic drugs.  These include Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal, phenytoin and phenobarbital.  These are elicited to allergies, but she has not had any true allergic reactions to these.  Actually, it has resulted in an allergic reaction resulting in rash and hypotension.,She also had been treated with Clobazam.  Her best control is with her current regimen of valproic acid and Tranxene.  Other attempts to taper Topamax, but this resulted increased seizures.  She also has oligohidrosis during this summertime.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Include Diastat 20 mg; Topamax 25 mg b.i.d., which is 3.3 per kilo per day; Tranxene 15 mg b.i.d.; Depakote 125 mg t.i.d., which is 25 per kilo per day.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 15 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient was awake, she appeared sedated and postictal.,NECK:  Supple.,NEUROLOGICAL:  She had a few brief myoclonic jerks of her legs during drowsiness, but otherwise no overt seizure, no seizure activity nor involuntary movements were observed.,She was able to follow commands such as when I request that she gave mom a kiss.  She acknowledged her doll.  Left fundus is sharp.  She resisted the rest of the exam.  There was no obvious lateralized findings.,ASSESSMENT:,  Status epilepticus resolved.  Triggered by a febrile illness, possibly viral.  Refractory remote symptomatic partial epilepsy.,IMPRESSION: , I discussed the maximizing Depakote to mom and she concurred.  I recommend increasing her maintenance dose to one in the morning, one in the day, and two at bedtime.  For today, she did give an IV Depacon 250 mg and the above dosage can be continued IV until she is taking p.o.  Dr. X agreed with the changes and orders were written for this.  She can continue her current doses of Topamax and Tranxene.  This can be given by NG if needed.  Topamax can be potentially increased to 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night.  I will be available as needed during the rest of her hospitalization.  Mom will call contact Dr. Y an update him about the recent changes.",Neurology

After this had been completed, a #15 blade was used to make small stab wounds in the lateral hips, the pubic area, and upper edge of the umbilicus.  Through these small incisions, a cannula was used to infiltrate lactated Ringers with 1000 cc was infiltrated initially into the abdomen.  A 3 and 4-mm cannulas were then used to carry out the liposuction of the abdomen removing a total of 1100 cc of aspirate, which was mostly fat, little fluid, and blood.  Attention was then directed to the thighs both inner and outer.  A total of 1000 cc was infiltrated in both lateral thighs only about 50 cc in the medial thighs.  After this had been completed, 3 and 4-mm cannulas were used to suction 650 cc from each side, approximately 50 cc in the inner thigh and 600 on each lateral thigh.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  All of this aspirate was mostly fat with little fluid and very little blood.  Wounds were cleaned and steri-stripped and dressing of ABD pads and ***** was then applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition.",Bariatrics

The patient has a history of IVDA and contracted hepatitis C with slightly elevated liver transaminases.  The patient had been seen through our office for prenatal care.  The patient is on Valtrex.  The patient was found to be 3 cm about 40%, 0 to 9 engaged.  Bag of waters was ruptured.  She was on Pitocin.  She was contracting appropriately for a couple of hours or so with appropriate ________.  There was no cervical change noted.  Most probably because there was a sink vertex and that the head was too large to descend into the pelvis.  The patient was advised of this and we recommended cesarean section.  She agreed.  We discussed the surgery, foreseeable risks and complications, alternative treatment, the procedure itself, and recovery in layman's terms.  The patient's questions were answered.  I personally made sure that she understood every aspect of the consent and that she was comfortable with the understanding of what would transpire.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was then taken back to operative suite.  She was given anesthetic and sterilely prepped and draped.  Pfannenstiel incision was used.  A second knife was used to carry the incision down to the anterior rectus fascia.  Anterior rectus fascia was incised in the midline and carried bilaterally and the fascia was lifted off the underlying musculature.  The rectus muscles were separated.  The patient's peritoneum tented up towards the umbilicus and we entered the abdominal cavity.  There was a very thin lower uterine segment.  There seemed to be quite a large baby.  The patient had a small nick in the uterus.  Following the blunt end of the bladder knife going through the innermost layer of the myometrium and into the endometrial cavity, clear amniotic fluid was obtained.  A blunt low transverse cervical incision was made.  Following this, we placed a ________ on the very large fetal head.  The head was delivered following which we were able to deliver a large baby girl, 9 lb, good at tone and cry.  The patient then underwent removal of the placenta after the cord blood and ABG were taken.  The patient's uterus was examined.  There appeared to be no retained products.  The patient's uterine incision was reapproximated and sutured with #0 Vicryl in a running non-interlocking fashion, the second imbricating over the first.  The patient's uterus was hemostatic.  Bladder flap was reapproximated with #0 Vicryl.  The patient then underwent an irrigation at every level of closure and the patient was quite hemostatic.  We reapproximated the rectus musculature with care being taken not to incorporate any underlying structures.  The patient had three interrupted sutures of this.  The fascia was reapproximated with two stitches of #0 Vicryl going from each apex towards the midline.  The Scarpa's fascia was reapproximated with #0 gut.  There was noted no fascial defects and the skin was closed with #0 Vicryl.,Prior to closing the abdominal cavity, the uterus appeared to be intact and bladder appeared to have clear urine and appeared to be intact.

4136,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Please evaluate stomatitis, possibly methotrexate related.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a very pleasant 57-year old white female, a native of Cuba, being seen for evaluation and treatment of sores in her mouth that she has had for the last 10-12 days.  The patient has a long history of severe and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis for which she has had numerous treatments, but over the past ten years she has been treated with methotrexate quite successfully.  Her dosage has varied somewhere between 20 and 25 mg per week.  About the beginning of this year, her dosage was decreased from 25 mg to 20 mg, but because of the flare of the rheumatoid arthritis, it was increased to 22.5 mg per week.  She has had no problems with methotrexate as far as she knows.  She also took an NSAID about a month ago that was recently continued because of the ulcerations in her mouth.  About two weeks ago, just about the time the stomatitis began she was placed on an antibiotic for suspected upper respiratory infection.  She does not remember the name of the antibiotic.  Although she claims she remembers taking this type of medication in the past without any problems.  She was on that medication three pills a day for three to four days.  She notes no other problems with her skin.  She remembers no allergic reactions to medication.  She has no previous history of fever blisters.  ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, Reveals superficial erosions along the lips particularly the lower lips.  The posterior buccal mucosa along the sides of the tongue and also some superficial erosions along the upper and lower gingiva.  Her posterior pharynx was difficult to visualize, but I saw no erosions on the areas today.  There did however appear to be one small erosion on the soft palate.  Examination of the rest of her skin revealed no areas of dermatitis or blistering.  There were some macular hyperpigmentation on the right arm where she has had a previous burn, plus the deformities from her rheumatoid arthritis on her hands and feet as well as scars on her knees from total joint replacement surgeries.  ,IMPRESSION: , Erosive stomatitis probably secondary to methotrexate even though the medication has been used for ten years without any problems.  Methotrexate may produce an erosive stomatitis and enteritis after such a use. The patient also may have an enteritis that at this point may have become more quiescent as she notes that she did have some diarrhea about the time her mouth problem developed. She has had no diarrhea today, however. She has noted no blood in her stools and has had no episodes of nausea or vomiting.  ,I am not as familiar with the NSAID causing an erosive stomatitis.  I understand that it can cause gastrointestinal upset, but given the choice between the two, I would think the methotrexate is the most likely etiology for the stomatitis.  ,RECOMMENDED THERAPY: ,I agree with your therapeutic regimen regarding this condition with the use of prednisone and folic acid.  I also agree that the methotrexate must be discontinued in order to produce a resolution of this patients’ skin problem. However, in my experience, this stomatitis may take a number of weeks to go away completely if a patient been on methotrexate, for an extended period of time, because the medication is stored within the liver and in fatty tissue.  Topically I have prescribed Lidex gel, which I find works extremely well in stomatitis conditions.  It can be applied t.i.d.  ,Thank you very much for allowing me to share in the care of this pleasant patient.  I will follow her with you as needed.",Consult - History and Phy.

Risks, benefits, alternatives of the procedures were discussed in great detail with the patient.  Risks include but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, vocal fold paralysis, hoarseness, low calcium, need for calcium supplementation, tumor recurrence, need for additional treatment, need for thyroid medication, cosmetic deformity, and other.  The patient understood all these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine in a operating room table.  After establishing general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation with a 6 Nerve Integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were then tacked with Tegaderm.  The Nerve Integrity monitoring system, endotracheal tube was confirmed to be working adequately.  Essentially a 7 cm incision was employed in the lower skin crease of the neck.  A 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were given.  Shoulder roll was applied.  The patient prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A 15-blade was used to make the incision.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised to the thyroid notch and sternal respectively.  The strap muscles were separated in the midline.  As we then turned to the left side where the sternohyoid muscle was separated from the sternothyroid muscle there was a very dense and firm thyroid mass on the left side.  The sternothyroid muscle was transected horizontally.  Similar procedure was performed on the right side.,Attention was then turned to identify the trachea in the midline.  Veins in this area and the pretracheal region were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  Subsequently, attention was turned to dissecting the capsule off of the left thyroid lobe.  Again this was very firm in nature.  The superior thyroid pole was dissected in the superior third artery, vein, and the individual vessels were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  The inferior and superior parathyroid glands were protected.  Recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified in the tracheoesophageal groove.  This had arborized early as a course underneath the inferior thyroid artery to a very small tiny anterior motor branch.  This was followed superiorly.  The level of cricothyroid membrane upon complete visualization of the entire nerve, Berry's ligament was transected and the nerve protected and then the thyroid gland was dissected over the trachea.  A prominent pyramidal level was also appreciated and dissected as well.,Attention was then turned to the right side.  There was significant amount of thyroid tissue that was very firm.  Multiple nodules were appreciated.  In a similar fashion, the capsule was dissected.  The superior and inferior parathyroid glands protected and preserved.  The superior thyroid artery and vein were individually ligated with the harmonic scalpel and the inferior thyroid artery was then ligated close to the thyroid gland capsule.  Once the recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified again on this side, the nerve had arborized early prior to the coursing underneath the inferior thyroid artery.  The anterior motor branch was then very fine, almost filamentous and stimulated at 0.5 milliamps, completely dissected toward the cricothyroid membrane with complete visualization.  A small amount of tissue was left at the Berry's ligament as the remainder of thyroid level was dissected over the trachea.  The entire thyroid specimen was then removed, marked with a stitch upon the superior pole.  The wound was copiously irrigated, Valsalva maneuver was given, bleeding points controlled.  The parathyroid glands appeared to be viable.  Both the anterior motor branches that were tiny were stimulated at 5 milliamps and confirmed to be working with the Nerve Integrity monitoring system.,Attention was then turned to burying the Surgicel on the wound bed on both sides.  The strap muscles were reapproximated in the midline using a 3-0 Vicryl suture of the sternothyroid horizontal transection and the strap muscles in the midline were then reapproximated.  The 1/8th inch Hemovac drain was placed and secured with a 3-0 nylon.  The incision was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and Indermil for the skin.  The patient has a history of keloid formation and approximately 1 cubic centimeter of 40 mg per cubic centimeter Kenalog was injected into the incisional line using a tuberculin syringe and 25-gauge needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room table, and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a good condition.  Upon completion of the case, fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed intact bilateral true vocal fold mobility.",Surgery

The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his left elbow fracture dislocation.  The patient also sustained a nondisplaced right glenoid neck fracture.  The patient's fracture has healed without incident, although he had significant postoperative stiffness for which he is undergoing physical therapy, as well as use of a Dynasplint.  The patient is neurologically intact distally.  Given the fact that his fracture has healed, surgery was recommended for hardware removal to decrease his irritation with elbow extension from the hardware.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, continued postoperative stiffness.  All questions were answered and the parents agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient's left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Using fluoroscopy, the patient's K-wire was located.  An incision was made over his previous scar.  A subcutaneous dissection then took place in the plane between the subcutaneous fat and muscles.  The K-wires were easily palpable.  A small incision was made into the triceps, which allowed for visualization of the two pins, which were removed without incident.  The wound was then irrigated.  The triceps split was now closed using #2-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was also closed using #2-0 Vicryl and the skin with #4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s, as well as bias.  A total of 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the incision, as well as the joint line.  At the beginning of the case, prior to removal of the hardware, the arm was taken through some strenuous manipulations with improvement of his extension to 20 degrees, flexion to 130 degrees and pronation supination to about 40 degrees.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The postoperative films demonstrated no fracture, no retained hardware.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will restart physical therapy and Dynasplint in 3 days.  The patient is to follow up in 1 week's time for a wound check.  The patient was given Tylenol No.  3 for pain.",Orthopedic

Informed consent was signed and placed on the chart.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  Procedure as well as inherent risks were again discussed with parents prior to the procedure.  After anesthesia was induced in the operating room, tetracaine drops were applied to each eye and the pressure of the eyes were checked with Tono-Pen.  The pressure on the right was 17 mmHg and on the left was 16 mmHg.,A punctal dilator was then used to dilate the left superior puncta.  A size 00 Bowman probe was used to navigate the superior puncta and canaliculus with traction of the eyelid temporally.  The probe was advanced until a firm stop of the lacrimal bone was felt.  The probe was rotated in a superior and medial fashion along the brow to allow for navigation through the nasolacrimal sac and duct.  A mild resistance was felt at the distal aspect of the nasolacrimal duct consistent with a location of the valve.  There was also some mild stenosis distally, but not felt significant.  The probe was used to navigate through this mild resistance.  A second Bowman probe was then placed through the left naris and metal on metal contact was felt confirming patency.  Both probes were removed.  The 00 Bowman probe was then used to navigate the inferior puncta canaliculus system.  Patency was confirmed.  The left upper lid was everted and inspected and was found to be normal.,Attention was then turned to the right side where the similar procedure through the right superior puncta was performed.  A punctal dilator was used to dilate the puncta followed by a size 00 Bowman probe.  Again on this side, a size 0 Bowman probe was unable to be placed initially to the superior puncta.  The probe was used to navigate the superior puncta, canaliculus, and then the probe was rotated superomedially and the probe was advanced.  Similar amount of distal stenosis and distal nasolacrimal duct obstruction was felt.  The mild resistance was over come at the approximate location of the valve.  Metal-on-metal feel confirmed patency through the right naris with a second metal probe.  At the completion of the procedure all probes were removed.

3448,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Antibiotic management for a right foot ulcer and possible osteomyelitis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of diabetes mellitus.  He was doing fairly well until last week while mowing the lawn, he injured his right foot.  He presented to the Hospital Emergency Room.  Cultures taken from the wound on 06/25/2008, were reported positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).  The patient was started on intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin and later on that was changed to oral formulation.  The patient underwent debridement of the wound on 07/29/2008.  Apparently, MRI and a bone scan was performed at that facility, which was reported negative for osteomyelitis.  The patient was then referred to the wound care center at General Hospital.  From there, he has been admitted to Long-Term Acute Care Facility for wound care with wound VAC placement.  On exam, he has a lacerated wound on the plantar aspect of the right foot, which extends from the second metatarsal area to the fifth metatarsal area, closed with the area of the head of these bones.  The wound itself is deep and stage IV and with exam of her gloved finger in my opinion, the third metatarsal bone is palpable, which leads to the clinical diagnosis of osteomyelitis.  The patient has serosanguineous drainage in this wound and it tracks under the skin in all directions except distal.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Positive for:,1.  Diabetes mellitus.,2.  Osteomyelitis of the right fifth toe, which was treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks about 5 years back.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Positive for mother passing away in her late 60s from heart attack, father had liver cancer, and passed away from that.

He has undergone debridement on 07/29/2008.  Culture results from the debridement procedure are not available.  Wound cultures from 07/25/2008 showed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.,From the Infectious Disease point of view, the patient has the following problems, and I would recommend following treatments strategy.,1.  Right foot infected ulcer with clinical evidence of osteomyelitis.  Even if the MRI and bone scan are negative, the treatment should be guided with diagnosis on clinical counts in my opinion.

2715,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left acoustic neuroma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuroma.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , This patient had a 3-cm acoustic neuroma.  The tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,Following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery.  She was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with Mayfield pins.  The left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion.  Transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve EMG monitoring were placed, and no response was verified.  The proposed incision was injected with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  Next, T-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease.  The incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use.,Incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip.  Periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone.  Emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax.  Bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure.  Using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed.  The sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly.  From these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed.  Bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in Siloxane suspension for later use.  The bone flap was also left at the site for further use.  Dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base.  Bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus.  There was extensively aerated temporal bone.  At this point, Dr. Trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor.  The cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure.  Once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone.  The dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone.  Then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out.  The bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm.  There was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well.  The dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor.  The tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult.  Therefore, Dr. Trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor.  With dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem.  The eighth nerve was identified and transected.  Tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem.  The facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well.  It was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve.  Attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed.  The superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus.  At this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct.  The tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated.  The tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor.  The nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face.  Further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally.  However, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated.  However, the tumor was then thinned using CUSA down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness.  It was released from the brainstem ventrally.  The tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes.  Overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume.  At this point, Dr. Trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis.  The air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax.  A piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect.  Next, the dura was closed with DuraGen and DuraSeal.  The bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect.  Postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels.  Sterile mastoid dressing was then placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in a stable condition.  All counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,100 mL.",Neurosurgery

A thigh high tourniquet was placed.  He is prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Limb was elevated, exsanguinated and tourniquet placed at 325 mmHg for approximately 30 to 40 minutes.  Straight incision is carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue anteriorly.  Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation.  Patellar tendon was isolated along with the patella itself.,A 6 mm Dacron tape x2 was placed with a modified Kessler tendon stitch with a single limb both medially and laterally and a central limb with subsequent shared tape.  The inferior pole was freshened up.  Drill bit was utilized to make holes x3 longitudinally across the patella and the limbs strutted up through the patella with a suture passer.  This was tied over the bony bridge superiorly.  There was excellent reduction of the tendon to the patella.  Interrupted running #1-Vicryl suture was utilized for over silk.  A running #2-0 Vicryl for synovial closure medial and laterally as well as #1-Vicryl medial and lateral retinaculum.  There was excellent repair.  Copious irrigation was carried out.  Tourniquet was dropped and hemostasis controlled via electrocoagulation.  Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and skin staples were placed through the skin.

The fluoroscopy x-ray unit was then brought into the sterile field for a PA x-ray visualization of the spine.  A Steinmann pin was then placed across the spine to localize the level of the planned injection.  Local infiltration using 0.5% preservative-free Xylocaine via a 25-gauge needle was then placed into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue.  A Tuohy needle was then oriented perpendicular to the skin and was then advanced through the dermis and subcutaneous tissues.

2090,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Back pain and right leg pain.  The patient has a three-year history of small cell lung cancer with metastases.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is on my schedule today to explore treatment of the above complaints.  She has a two-year history of small cell lung cancer, which she says has spread to metastasis in both femurs, her lower lumbar spine, and her pelvis.  She states she has had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments and told me that she has lost count.  She says she has just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief.  She states she continues to have significant pain symptoms.  Most of her pain seems to be in her low back on the right side, radiating down the back of her right leg to her knee.  She has also some numbness in the bottom of her left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times.  She complains of some diffuse, mid back pain.  She describes the pain as sharp, dull, and aching in nature.  She rates her back pain as 10, her right leg pain as 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain.  She states that it seems to be worse while sitting in the car with prolonged sitting, standing, or walking.  She is on significant doses of narcotics.  She has had multiple CT scans looking for metastasis.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for cancer as above.  She also has a depression.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for a chest port placement.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Consist of Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet.  She does not know of what strength up to eight daily.  She also is on warfarin 1 mg daily, which she states is just to keep her chest port patent.  She is on Neurontin 300 mg three times daily.,HABITS:,  She smokes one pack a day for last 30 years.  She drinks beer approximately twice daily.  She denies use of recreational drugs.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  She is married.  She lives with her spouse.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Significant for two brothers and father who have cancer.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Significant mainly for her pain complaints.  For other review of systems the patient seems stable.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  Reveals a pleasant somewhat emaciated Caucasian female.,Vital Signs:  Height is 5 feet 2 inches.  Weight is 130 pounds.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Benign.,Neck:  Shows functional range of movements with a negative Spurling's.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.,Abdomen:  Soft, regular bowel sounds.,Musculoskeletal:  Examination shows functional range of joint movements.  No focal muscle weakness.  She is deconditioned.,Neurologic:  She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect.  The patient has normal tone and coordination.  Reflexes are 2+ in both knees and absent at both ankles.  Sensations are decreased distally in the left foot, otherwise intact to pinprick.,Spine:  Examination of her lumbar spine shows normal lumbar lordosis with fairly functional range of movement.  The patient had significant tenderness at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints, which seems to reproduce a lot of her low back and right leg complaints.,FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION: , Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it.,INVESTIGATION: , She has had again multiple scans including a whole body bone scan, which showed abnormal uptake involving the femurs bilaterally.  She has had increased uptake in the sacroiliac joint regions bilaterally.  CT of the chest showed no evidence of recurrent metastatic disease.  CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of metastatic disease.  MRI of the lower hip joints showed heterogenous bone marrow signal in both proximal femurs.  CT of the pelvis showed a trabecular pattern with healed metastases.  CT of the orbits showed small amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells on the right, otherwise normal CT scan.  MR of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities and no significant interval changes.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Small cell lung cancer with metastasis at the lower lumbar spine, pelvis, and both femurs.,2.  Symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right.,3.  Chronic pain syndrome.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology.  Dr. XYZ explained her although she does have lung cancer metastasis, she seems to be symptomatic with primarily pain at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints on the right.  Secondary to the patient's significant pain complaints today, Dr. XYZ will plan on injecting her right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today.  I explained the rationale for the procedure, possible complications, and she voiced understanding and wished to proceed.  She understands that she is on warfarin therapy and that we generally do not perform injections while they are on this.  We have asked for stat protime today.  She is on a very small dose, she states she has had previous biopsies while on this before, and did not have any complications.  She is on significant dose of narcotics already, however, she continues to have pain symptoms.  Dr. XYZ advised that if she continues to have pain, even after this injection, she could put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra Percocet if needed.  I will plan on evaluating her in the Clinic on Tuesday.  I have also asked that she stop her Paxil, and we plan on starting her on Cymbalta instead.  She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan.  I have also asked her to get an x-ray of the lumbar spine for further evaluation.  Physical exam, findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. G's findings.  Peripheral neuropathy of her left foot is most likely secondary to her chemo and radiation treatments.",Orthopedic
1346,"SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient returns today for a followup.  She was recently in the hospital and was found to be septic from nephrolithiasis.  This was all treated.  She did require a stent in the left ureter.  Dr. XYZ took care of this.  She had a stone, which was treated with lithotripsy.  She is now back here for followup.  I had written out all of her medications with their dose and schedule on a progress sheet.  I had given her instructions regarding follow up here and follow with Dr. F.  Unfortunately, that piece of paper was lost.  Somehow between the hospital and home she lost it and has not been able to find it.  She has no followup appointment with Dr. F.  The day after she was dismissed, her nephew called me stating that the prescriptions were lost, instructions were lost, etc.  Later she apparently found the prescriptions and they were filled.  She tells me she is taking the antibiotic, which I believe was Levaquin and she has one more to take.  She had no clue as to seeing Dr. XYZ again.

He presented now after informed consent for the above procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was identified in the preanesthesia area, then taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position on the operating table, and induced under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient was correctly positioned, padded at all pressure points, had antiembolic TED hose and Flowtrons in the lower extremities.  The anterior abdomen was then prepared and draped in a sterile fashion.  Preemptive local anesthetic was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine and 0.5% ropivacaine.  The initial incision was made sharply at the umbilicus with a #15-scalpel blade and carried down through deeper tissues with Bovie cautery, down to the midline fascia with a #15 scalpel blade.  The blunt-tipped Hasson introducer cannula was placed into the abdominal cavity under direct vision where it was insufflated using carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  The epigastric and right subcostal trocars were placed under direct vision.  The right upper quadrant was well visualized.  The gallbladder was noted to be significantly distended with surrounding dense adhesions.  The fundus of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted anteriorly and superiorly, and the surrounding adhesions were then taken down off the gallbladder using a combination of the bullet-nose Bovie dissector and the blunt Kittner peanut dissector.  Further dissection allowed identification of the infundibulum and cystic duct junction where the cystic duct was identified and dissected out further using a right-angle clamp.  The cystic duct was clipped x3 and then divided.  The cystic artery was dissected out in like fashion, clipped x3, and then divided.  The gallbladder was then taken off the liver bed in a retrograde fashion using the hook-tip Bovie cautery with good hemostasis.  Prior to removal of the gallbladder, all irrigation fluid was clear.  No active bleeding or oozing was seen.  All clips were noted to be secured and intact and in place.  The gallbladder was placed in a specimen pouch after placing the camera in the epigastric port.  The gallbladder was retrieved through the umbilical fascial defect and submitted to Pathology.  The camera was placed back once again into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port, and all areas remained clean and dry and the trocar was removed under direct visualization.  The insufflation was allowed to escape.  The umbilical fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl sutures.  Finally, the skin was closed in a layered subcuticular fashion with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,",Surgery

On physical exam, the patient was found to have grade 3 rectocele and poor apical support, and history of hysterectomy.  The patient had good anterior support at the bladder.  Options were discussed such as watchful waiting, pessary, repair with and without mesh, and closing of the vagina (colpocleisis) were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, morbidity, and mortality of the procedure were discussed., ,Risk of infection and abscess formation were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  Risk of retention and incontinence were discussed.  Consent was obtained through the family members.,DETAILS OF THE OR:,  The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had a Foley catheter placed.  The posterior side of the rectocele was visualized with grade 3 rectocele and poor apical support.  A 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was applied for posterior hydrodissection, which was very difficult to do due to the significant scarring of the posterior part.  Attempts were made to lift the vaginal mucosa off of the rectum, which was very, very difficult to do at this point due to the patient's overall poor medical condition in terms of poor mobility and significant scarring.  Discussion was done with the family in the waiting area regarding simply closing the vagina and doing a colpocleisis since the patient is actually inactive.  Family agreed that she is not active and they rather not have any major invasive procedure especially in light of scarring and go ahead and perform the colpocleisis.  Oral consent was obtained from the family and her surgery was preceded.  The vaginal mucosa was denuded off using electrocautery and Metzenbaum scissors.  Using 0 Vicryl, 2 transverse longitudinal stitches were placed to bring the anterior and the posterior part of the vagina together and was started at the apex and was brought all the way out to the introitus.  The vaginal mucosa was pretty much completely closed off all the way up to the introitus.  Indigo carmine was given.  Cystoscopy revealed there was a good efflux of urine from both of the ureteral openings.  There was no injury to the bladder or kinking of the ureteral openings.  The bladder was normal.  Rectal exam was normal at the end of the colpocleisis repair.  There was good hemostasis., ,At the end of the procedure, Foley was removed and the patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.",Surgery

The patient was noted with acute respiratory distress on ventilator support with both ventilator asynchrony and progressive desaturation.  Chest x-ray as noted above revealed complete atelectasis of the left lung.  The patient was subsequently sedated and received one dose of paralytic as noted above followed by emergent fiberoptic flexible bronchoscopy.,PROCEDURE DETAIL,:  A bronchoscope was inserted through the oroendotracheal tube, which was partially obstructed with blood clots.  These were lavaged with several aliquots of normal saline until cleared.  The bronchoscope required removal because the tissue/clots were obstructing the bronchoscope.  The bronchoscope was reinserted on several occasions until cleared and advanced to the main carina.  The endotracheal tube was noted to be in good position.  The bronchoscope was advanced through the distal trachea.  There was a white tissue completely obstructing the left main stem at the carina.  The bronchoscope was advanced to this region and several aliquots of normal saline lavage were instilled and suctioned.  Again this partially obstructed the bronchoscope requiring several times removing the bronchoscope to clear the lumen.  The bronchoscope subsequently was advanced into the left mainstem and subsequently left upper and lower lobes.  There was diffuse mucus impactions/tissue as well as intermittent clots.  There was no evidence of any active bleeding noted.  Bronchoscope was adjusted and the left lung lavaged until no evidence of any endobronchial obstruction is noted.  Bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the main carina and advanced into the right bronchial system.  There is no plugging or obstruction of the right bronchial system.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the main carina and slowly withdrawn as the position of endotracheal tube was verified, approximately 4 cm above the main carina.  The bronchoscope was then completely withdrawn as the patient was maintained on ventilator support during and postprocedure.  Throughout the procedure, pulse oximetry was greater than 95% throughout.  There is no hemodynamic instability or variability noted during the procedure.  Postprocedure chest x-ray is pending at this time.",Emergency Room Reports

Mitral valve posterior annuloplasty using a Cosgrove Galloway Medtronic fuser band.,3.  Posterior leaflet abscess resection.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia,TIMES:  ,Aortic cross-clamp time was ** minutes.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time total was ** minutes.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next, the patient's chest and legs were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A #10-blade scalpel was used to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw, and full-dose heparinization was given.  Next, the chest retractor was positioned.  The pericardium was opened with Bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  We then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 Ethibond double pursestring was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next, double cannulation with venous cannulas was instituted.  A 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our SEC cannula.  This was connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a Y-shaped circuit.  Next, a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the lower border of the right atrium.  Through this was passed our inferior vena cava cannula.  This was likewise connected to the Y connection of our venous cannula portion.  We then used a 4-0 U-stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter, which was inserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the SVC and IVC, which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape.  Sondergaard's groove was taken down.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  This was connected appropriately as was the retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  Next, the aorta was cross-clamped, and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia was infused so as to arrest the heart in diastole.  Next a #15-blade scalpel was used to open the left atrium.  The left atrium was decompressed with pump sucker.  Next, our self-retaining retractor was positioned so as to bring the mitral valve up into view.  Of note was the fact that the mitral valve P2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it.  The borders of the P2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 4-0 silk.  After doing so, the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet was excised with a #11-blade scalpel.  Given the laxity of the posterior leaflet, it was decided to reconstruct it with a 2-0 Ethibond pledgeted suture.  This was done so as to reconstruct the posterior annular portion.  Prior to doing so, care was taken to remove any debris and abscess-type material.  The pledgeted stitch was lowered into place and tied.  Next, the more anterior portion of the P2 segment was reconstructed by running a 4-0 Prolene stitch so as to reconstruct it.  This was done without difficulty.  The apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet was confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle.  There was noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation.  It was felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure.  Next, 2-0 non-pledgeted Ethibond sutures were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion.  Care was taken to go from trigone to trigone.  Prior to placing these sutures, the annulus was sized and noted to be a *** size for the Cosgrove-Galloway suture band ring from Medtronic.  After, as mentioned, we placed our interrupted sutures in the annulus, and they were passed through the CG suture band.  The suture band was lowered into position and tied in place.  We then tested our repair and noted that there was very mild regurgitation.  We subsequently removed our self-retaining retractor.  We closed our left atriotomy using 4-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  This was done without difficulty.  We de-aired the heart.  We then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion.  The aortic cross-clamp was removed, and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity.  We then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 5-0 Prolene.  We placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing leads which were brought out through the skin.  The patient was gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannulas were removed.  We then gave full-dose protamine; and after noting that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed our aortic cannula.  This site was buttressed with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.

4135,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Renal failure evaluation for possible dialysis therapy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 47-year-old gentleman, who works offshore as a cook, who about 4 days ago noted that he was having some swelling in his ankles and it progressively got worse over the past 3 to 4 days, until he was swelling all the way up to his mid thigh bilaterally.  He also felt like he could not make much urine, and his wife, who is a nurse instructed him to force fluids.  While he was there, he was drinking cranberry juice, some Powerade, but he also has a history of weightlifting and had been taking on a creatine protein drink on a daily basis for some time now.  He presented here with very decreased urine output until a Foley catheter was placed and about 500 mL was noted in his bladder.  He did have a CPK level of about 234 while his BUN and creatinine on admission were 109 and 6.9.  Despite IV hydration fluids, his potassium has gone up from 5.4 to 6.1.  He did not put out any significant urine and his weight was documented at 103 kg.  He was given a dose of Kayexalate.  His potassium came down to like about 5.9 and urine studies were ordered.  His urinalysis did show that he had microscopic hematuria and proteinuria and his protein-creatinine ratio was about 9 gm of protein consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria.  He did have a low albumin of 1.9.  He denied any nonsteroidal usage, any recreational drug abuse, and his urine drug screen was unremarkable, and he denied any history of hypertension or any other medical problems.  He has not had any blood work except for drug screens that are required by work and no work up by any primary care physician because he has not seen one for primary care.  He is very concerned because his mother and father were both on dialysis, which he thinks were due to diabetes and both parents have expired.  He denied any hemoptysis, gross hematuria, melena, hematochezia, hemoptysis, hematemesis, no seizures, no palpitations, no pruritus, no chest pain.  He did have a decrease in his appetite, which all started about Thursday.  We were asked to see this patient in consultation by Dr. X because of his renal failure and the need for possible dialysis therapy.  He was significantly hypertensive on admission with a blood pressure of 162/80.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Both mother and father were on dialysis of end-stage renal disease.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He is married.  He does smoke despite understanding the risks associated with smoking a pack every 6 days.  Does not drink alcohol or use any recreational drug use.  He was on no prescribed medications.

Acute kidney injury of which etiology is unknown at this time, with progressive azotemia unresponsive to IV fluids.,2.  Hyperkalemia due to renal failure, slowly improving with Kayexalate.,3.  Microscopic hematuria with nephrotic range proteinuria, more consistent with a glomerulonephropathy nephritis.,4.  Hypertension.,PLAN: , I will give him Kayexalate 15 gm p.o. q.6h. x 2 more doses since he is responding and his potassium is already down to 5.2.  I will also recheck a urinalysis, consult the surgeon in the morning for temporary hemodialysis catheter placement, and consult case managers to start work on a transfer to ABCD Center per the patient and his wife's request, which will occur after his second dialysis treatment if he remains stable.  We will get a BMP, phosphorus, mag, CBC in the morning since he was given 80 mg of Lasix for fluid retention.  We will also give him 10 mg of Zaroxolyn p.o.  Discontinue all IV fluids.  Check an ANCA hepatitis profile, C3 and C4 complement levels along with CH 50 level.  I did discuss with the patient and his wife the need for kidney biopsy and they would like the kidney biopsy to be performed closer to home at Ochsner where his family is, since he only showed up here because of the nearest hospital located to his offshore job.  I do agree with getting him transferred once he is stable from his hyperkalemia and he starts his dialysis.,I appreciate consult.  I did discuss with him the importance of the kidney biopsies to direct treatment, finding the underlying etiology of his acute renal failure and to also give him prognostic factors of renal recovery.",Consult - History and Phy.

The plan is for repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position, and sterilely prepped and draped.  A superior curvilinear scrotal incision was then made in the left hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery into the subcutaneous tissue.  We then used the curved cryoclamp to dissect into the scrotal space and found the tunica vaginalis and dissected this up to the external ring.  We were able to dissect all the way up to the ring, but were unable to get the testis delivered.  We then made a left inguinal incision with a 15-blade knife, further extending with electrocautery through Scarpa fascia down to the external oblique fascia.  The testis again was not visualized in the external ring, so we brought the sac up from the scrotum into the inguinal incision and then incised the external oblique fascia with a 15-blade knife further extending with Metzenbaum scissors.  The testis itself was quite high up in the upper canal.  We then dissected the gubernacular structures off of the testis, and also, then opened the sac, and dissected the sac off and found that he had a communicating hernia hydrocele and dissected the sac off with curved and straight mosquitos and a straight Joseph scissors.  Once this was dissected off and up towards the internal ring, it was twisted upon itself and suture ligated with an 0 Vicryl suture.  We then dissected the lateral spermatic fascia, and then, using blunt dissection, dissected in the retroperitoneal space to get more cord length.  We also dissected the sac from the peritoneal reflection up into the abdomen once it had been tied off.  We then found that we had an adequate amount of cord length to get the testis in the mid-to-low scrotum.  The patient was found to have a type III epididymal attachment with a long looping vas, and we brought the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation and tacked it to mid-to-low scrotum with a 4-0 chromic stay stitch.  The upper aspect of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic pursestring suture.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  We then placed the local anesthetic, and the ilioinguinal nerve block, and placed a small amount in both incisional areas as well.  We then closed the external oblique fascia with a running suture of 0-Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and cord structures were not bottom closure.  The Scarpa fascia was closed with a 4-0 chromic suture, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on the both incisions, and IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure.

The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery and vein.  Once adequate anesthesia has been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  A small nick was then made in the skin.  The pressure was held.  The needle was removed over the guidewire.  Next, a #6 French arterial sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was flushed.  Next, an angulated pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under the direct fluoroscopy visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The catheter was then guided into the left ventricle.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The catheter was then flushed.  LVEDP was measured and found to be favorable for a left ventriculogram.  The left ventriculogram was performed in the RAO position with a single power injection of nonionic contrast material.  LVEDP was then remeasured.  Pullback was performed, which failed to reveal an LVAO gradient.  The catheter was then removed.  Next, a Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the left main coronary was unable to be engaged with this catheter.  Thus it was removed over a guidewire.  Next, a Judkins left #5 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  Left main coronary artery was then engaged.  Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the left coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  The catheter was then removed from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and was removed over a guidewire.  Next, a Judkins right #4 catheter was then advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the right coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  The catheter was then removed from the ostium of the right coronary artery and then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  Because the patient did have high left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, it was determined that the patient wound need a right heart catheterization.  Thus an #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral vein.  A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen.  The needle was removed over the guidewire.  Next, an #8 French venous sheath was advanced over the guidewire into lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  Next, a Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced to the level of 20 cm.  The balloon was inflated.  Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was guided into the right atrium, right ventricle, and into the pulmonary artery wedge position.  Hemodynamics were measured along the way.  PA saturation, right atrial saturation, femoral artery saturation were all obtained.  Once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was then removed.  Both sheaths were flushed and found fine.

3069,"XYZ, O.D.,RE:  ABC,DOB:  MM/DD/YYYY,Dear Dr. XYZ:,Thank you for your referral of patient ABC.  The patient was referred for evaluation of cataracts bilaterally.,On examination, the patient was seeing 20/40 in her right eye and 20/50 in the left eye.  Extraocular muscles were intact, visual fields were full to confrontation OU, and applanations are 12 mmHg bilaterally.  There is no relative afferent pupillary defect.  On slit lamp examination, lids and lashes were within normal limits.  The conj is quiet.  The cornea shows 1+ guttata bilaterally.  The AC is deep and quiet and irises are within normal limits bilaterally.  There is a dense 3 to 4+ nuclear sclerotic cataract in each eye.  On dilated fundus examination, cup-to-disc ratio is 0.1 OU.  The vitreous, macula, vessels, and periphery all appear within normal limits.,Impression:  It appears that Ms. ABC' visual decline is caused by bilateral cataracts.  She would benefit from having removed.  The patient also showed some mild guttata OU indicating possible early Fuchs dystrophy.  The patient should do well with cataract surgery and I have recommended this and she agreed to proceed with the first eye here shortly.  I will keep you up to date of her progress and any new findings as we perform her surgery in each eye.,Again, thank you for your kind referral of this kind lady and I will be in touch with you.,Sincerely,,",Letters

She was evaluated and scheduled for an elective procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF SURGERY:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthetic was administered.  Once appropriate anesthetic findings were achieved, the patient was intubated and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for a tonsillectomy.  He was placed in semi-Rose ___ position and a Crowe Davis-type mouth gag was introduced into the oropharynx.  Under an operating headlight, the oropharynx was clearly visualized.  The right tonsil was grasped with the fossa triangularis and using electrocautery enucleation technique, was removed from its fossa.  This followed placing the patient in a suspension position using a McIvor-type mouth gag and a red rubber Robinson catheter via the right naris.  Once the right tonsil was removed, the left tonsil was removed in a similar manner, once again using a needle point Bovie dissection at 20 watts.  With the tonsils removed, it was possible to visualize the adenoid pads.  The oropharynx was irrigated and the adenoid pad evaluated with an indirect mirror technique.  The adenoid pad was greater than 2+/4 and hypertrophic.  It was removed with successive passes of electrocautery suction.  The tonsillar fossa was then once again hemostased with suction cautery, injected with 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution and then closed with 2-0 Monocryl on an SH needle.  The redundant soft tissue of the uvula was removed posteriorly and cauterized with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period.  The patient's oropharynx and nasopharynx were irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline contained with small amount of iodine, and she was recovered from her general endotracheal anesthetic.  She was extubated and left the operating room in good condition to the postoperative recovery room area.,Estimated blood loss was minimal.  There were no complications.

She presented to the emergency room where she was found to have significant hydronephrosis on the right without evidence of a stone.  She has some ureteral thickening in her distal right ureter.  She has persistent microscopic hematuria and her urine cytology and cytomolecular diagnosis significant for urothelial dysplasia with neoplasia-associated karyotypic profile.  She was brought to the operating room for further evaluation and treatment.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , After preoperative counseling, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthesia.  She was placed in the lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The 21-French cystoscope was inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The bladder was inspected and found to be without evidence of intravesical tumors, stones or mucosal abnormalities.  The right ureteral orifice was visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter.  This was gently advanced to the mid ureter.  Urine was collected for cytology.  Retrograde injection of saline through the ureteral catheter was then also used to enhance collection of the specimen.  This too was collected and sent for a pooled urine cytology as specimen from the right renal pelvis and ureter.  An 0.038 guidewire was then passed up through the open-ended ureteral catheter.  The open-ended ureteral catheter and cystoscope were removed, and over the guidewire the flexible ureteroscope was passed up to the level of the renal pelvis.  Using direct vision and fluoroscopy to confirm location, the entire renal pelvis and calyces were inspected.  The renal pelvis demonstrated an extrarenal pelvis, but no evidence of obstruction at the renal UPJ level.  There were no intrapelvic or calyceal stones.  The ureter demonstrated no significant mucosal abnormalities, no visible tumors, and no areas of apparent constriction on multiple passes of the ureteroscope through the ureter to evaluate.

Upon transfer, he had a right pleural effusion demonstrated on x-ray as well as some shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy were discussed with the patient and his family and they wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed.  SCDs were also placed and he was given preoperative Kefzol.  The patient was then brought into the right side up, left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A needle was inserted in the axillary line to determine position of the effusion.  At this time, a 10-mm port was placed using the knife and Bovie cautery.  The effusion was drained by placing a sucker into this port site.  Upon feeling the surface of the pleura, there were multiple firm nodules.  An additional anterior port was then placed in similar fashion.  The effusion was then drained with a sucker.  Multiple pleural biopsies were taken with the biopsy device in all areas of the pleura.  Of note, feeling the diaphragmatic surface, it appeared that it was quite nodular, but these nodules felt as though they were on the other side of the diaphragm and not on the pleural surface of the diaphragm concerning for a possibly metastatic disease.  This will be worked up with further imaging study later in his hospitalization.  After the effusion had been drained, 2 cans of talc pleurodesis aerosol were used to cover the lung and pleural surface with talc.  The lungs were then inflated and noted to inflate well.  A 32 curved chest tube chest tube was placed and secured with nylon.  The other port site was closed at the level of the fascia with 2-0 Vicryl and then 4-0 Monocryl for the skin.

Hardware consisted of two 4-5 K-wires, One 6.5, 60 mm partially threaded cancellous screw and one 45, 60 mm partially threaded cortical screw and 2 washers.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:,  The patient is a 14-year-old male who reported having knee pain for 1 month.  Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The patient's extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Midline incision was marked on the skin extending from the tibial tubercle proximally and extremities wrapped in Esmarch.  Finally, the patient had tourniquet that turned in 75 mmHg.  Esmarch was then removed.  The incision was then made.  The patient had significant  tearing of the posterior retinaculum medially with proximal migration of the tibial tubercle which was located in the joint there was a significant comminution and intraarticular involvement.  We were able to see the underside of the anterior horn of both medial and lateral meniscus.  The intraarticular cartilage was restored using two 45 K-wires.  Final position was checked via fluoroscopy and the corners were buried in the cartilage.  There was a large free floating metaphyseal piece that included parts of proximal tibial physis.  This was placed back in an anatomic location and fixed using a 45 cortical screw with a washer.  The avulsed fragment with the patellar tendon was then fixed distally to this area using a 6.5, 60 mm cancellous screw with a washer.  The cortical screw did not provide good compression and fixation at this distal fragment.  Retinaculum was repaired using 0 Vicryl suture as best as possible.  The hematoma was evacuated at the beginning of the case as well as the end.  The knee was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned, dried, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x4s.  Tourniquet was released at 80 minutes.  JP drain was placed on the medium gutter.  The extremity was then wrapped in Ace wrap from the proximal thigh down to the toes.  The patient was then placed in a knee mobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery in stable condition.,POSTOP PLAN:  ,The patient hospitalized overnight to decrease swelling and as well as manage his pain.  He may weightbear as tolerated using knee mobilizer.  Postoperative findings relayed to the grandmother.  The patient will need subsequent hardware removal.

The pain has become more and more severe.  It runs to the thumb and index finger of the right hand and it is accompanied by numbness.  If he tilts his neck backwards, the pain shoots down the arm.  If he is working with the computer, it is very difficult to use his mouse.  He tried conservative measures and failed to respond, so he sought out surgery.  Surgery was discussed with him in detail.  A C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was recommended.  He understood and wished to proceed with surgery.  Thus, he was brought in same day for surgery on 07/03/2007.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , He was given Ancef 1 g intravenously for infection prophylaxis and then transported to the OR.  There general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  He was positioned on the OR table with an IV bag between the scapulae.  The neck was slightly extended and taped into position.  A metal arch was placed across the neck and intraoperative x-ray was obtain to verify a good position for skin incision and the neck was prepped with Betadine and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A linear incision was created in the neck beginning just to the right of the midline extending out across the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The incision was extended through skin, subcutaneous fat, and platysma.  Hemostasis was assured with Bovie cautery.  The anterior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified and dissection was carried medial to this down to the carotid sheath.  The trachea and the esophagus were swept out of the way and dissection proceeded medial to the carotid sheath down between the two bellies of the longus colli muscle on to the anterior aspect of the spine.  A Bovie cautery was used to mobilize the longus colli muscle around initially what turned out to be C6-C7 disk based on x-rays and then around the C5-C6 disk space.  An intraoperative x-ray confirmed C5-C6 disk space had been localized and then the self-retained distraction system was inserted to maintain exposure.  A 15-blade knife was used to incise the C5-C6 disk and remove disk material. and distraction pins were inserted into C5-C6 and distraction placed across the disk space.  The operating microscope was then brought into the field and used throughout the case except for the closure.  Various pituitaries, #15 blade knife, and curette were used to evacuate the disk as best as possible.  Then, the Midas Rex drill was taken under the microscope and used to drill where the cartilaginous endplate driven back all the way into the posterior aspect of the vertebral body.  A nerve hook was swept underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and a fragment of disk was produced and was pulled up through the ligament.  A Kerrison rongeur was used to open up the ligament in this opening and then to march out in the both neural foramina.  A small amount of disk material was found at the right neural foramen.  After a good decompression of both neural foramina was obtained and the thecal sac was exposed throughout the width of the exposure, the wound was thoroughly irrigated.  A spacing mechanism was intact into the disk space and it was determined that a #7 spacer was appropriate.  So, a #7 machine bone implant was taken and tapped into disk space and slightly counter sunk.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated and inspected for hemostasis.  A Mystique plate 23 mm in length was then inserted and anchored to the anterior aspect of C5-C6 to hold the bone into position and the wound was once again irrigated.  The patient was valsalved.  There was no further bleeding seen and intraoperative x-ray confirmed a good position near the bone, plate, and screws and the wound was enclosed in layers.  The 3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate platysma and 3-0 Vicryl was used in inverted interrupted fashion to perform a subcuticular closure of the skin.  The wound was cleaned.,Mastisol was placed on the skin, and Steri-strips were used to approximate skin margins.  Sterile dressing was placed on the patient's neck.  He was extubated in the OR and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no complications.",Neurosurgery

Modified Le Fort I osteotomy.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE:, The patient has undergone previous surgical treatment and had a diagnosis of basal cell nevus syndrome.  Currently our plan is to remove the impacted third molar teeth, to remove a cystic lesion left posterior mandible, to remove 4 second bicuspid teeth as requested by her orthodontist, and to weaken and her maxilla to allow expansion by a modified Le Fort osteotomy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the operating table in supine position.  Following treatment under adequate general anesthesia via the orotracheal route, the patient was prepped and draped in a manner consistent with intraoral surgical procedures.  The oral cavity was suctioned, was drained of fluid and a throat pack was placed.  General anesthesia nursing service was notified and which was removed at the end of the procedure.  Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine concentration in 1:100,000 was injected into the labial vestibule of the maxilla bilaterally as well as the lateral areas associated with the extractions sites in lower jaw and the left posterior mandible for a total of 11 mL.  A Bovie electrocautery was utilized to make a vestibular incision, beginning in the second molar region of the maxilla superior to the mucogingival junction extending to the area of the cuspid teeth.  Subperiosteal dissection revealed lateral aspect of the maxilla immediately posterior to the second molar tooth where the third molar tooth was identified and was bony crypt.  Following use of Cerebromaxillary osteotome, elevated, and underwent complete removal of the dental follicle.  Secondly, tooth number 4 was removed.  Tooth number 13 was removed, and the opposite third molar tooth was removed through an identical incision on the opposite side.  Surgeon then utilized a #15 saw to make a horizontal osteotomy through the lateral aspect of the maxilla from the target plates, anteriorly to the area of the buttress region cross the anterior maxilla to a point adjacent to the piriform rim, 5 mm superior to the nasal floor, bilaterally Cerebromaxillary osteotome utilized to separate the maxilla from the target placed posteriorly and a 5 mm Tessier osteotome through a vertical incision anteriorly between roots of teeth numbers 8 and 9.  This resulted in the alternate mobilization of the two halves of the maxilla, or to allow expansion.  These wounds were all irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline and with antibiotic containing solution, closed with 3-0 chromic suture in running fashion for watertight closure.  Attention was directed to the mandible where the left posterior mandible was approached through a lateral vestibular incision overlying the external oblique ridge and brought anteriorly in an old scar.  The surgeons utilized cautery osteotome to identify a cystic lesion associated with the left posterior mandible, which was approximately 1 cm in width and 2.5 to 3 cm in vertical dimension immediately adjacent to the neurovascular bundle.  This wound was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline and concentrated solution of clindamycin.  Closed primarily with a 3-0 Vicryl suture in running fashion for a watertight closure.  Teeth number 20 and 29 where removed and 3-0 chromic suture placed.  This concluded the procedure.  All cottonoids and other sponges, throat pack were removed.  No complications were encountered.  The aforementioned cystic lesion was sent with specimen no drains were placed.  The blood loss from this procedure was approximately 100 mL.,The patient was returned over the care of the anesthesia where she was extubated in the operating room, taken from the operating room to the recovery room with stable vital signs and spontaneous respirations.",Surgery

As soon as satisfactory anesthesia and akinesia had been achieved, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual manner for sterile ophthalmic surgery.  A wire lid speculum was inserted.  Three modified sclerotomies were selected at 9, 10, and 1 o'clock.  At the 9 o'clock position, the Accurus infusion line was put in place and tied with a preplaced #7-0 Vicryl suture.  The two superior sites at 10 and 1 were opened up where the operating microscope with the optical illuminating system was brought into position, and closed vitrectomy was begun.  Initially formed core vitrectomy was performed and formed anterior vitreous was removed.  After this was completed, attention was placed in the posterior segment.  Several broad areas of vitreoretinal traction were noted over the posterior pole out of the equator where the previously noted retinal tears were noted.  These were carefully lifted and dissected off the edges of the flap tears and trimmed to the ora serrata.

She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month.  She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08.  She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y.  At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000.  Her ANC was 0.5.  She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots.  She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis.  She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.,Over the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath.  Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily.  Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records.  Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions.  She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia.  She specifically denied any fevers or chills.  However, she was complaining of chest pain.  She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough.  When she did cough, it was nonproductive.  While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations.  An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes.  The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe.  The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism.  Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT.  There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox.  There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.,At this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY,1.

Preoperative MRI scan showed evidence of herniated nucleus pulposus at C5-C6 and C6-C7 on the left.  The patient has failed epidural steroid injections.  Risks and benefits of the above procedure were discussed with the patient including bleeding, infection, muscle loss, nerve damage, paralysis, and death.,OPERATIVE REPORT: , The patient was taken to the OR and placed in the supine position.  After general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient's neck was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A horizontal incision was made on the left side of the neck at the level of the C6 vertebral body.  It was taken down through the subcutaneous tissues exposing the platysmus muscle.  The platysmus muscle was incised along the skin incision and the deep cervical fascia was bluntly dissected down to the anterior cervical spine.  An #18 gauge needle was placed in the C5-C6 interspace and the intraoperative x-ray confirmed that this was the appropriate level.  Next, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally on both the right and left side, and then a complete anterior cervical discectomy was performed.  The disk was very degenerated and brown in color.  There was an acute disk herniation through posterior longitudinal ligament.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and a bilateral foraminotomy was performed.  Approximately, 5 mm of the nerve root on both the right and left side was visualized.  A ball-ended probe could be passed up the foramen.  Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocautery and Surgiflo.  The end plates of C5 and C6 were prepared using a high-speed burr and a 6-mm lordotic machined allograft was malleted into place.  There was good bony apposition both proximally and distally.  Next, attention was placed at the C6-C7 level.  Again, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally and a complete anterior cervical discectomy at C6-C7 was performed.  The disk was degenerated and there was acute disk herniation in the posterior longitudinal ligament on the left.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed.  A bilateral foraminotomy was performed.  Approximately, 5 mm of the C7 nerve root was visualized on both sides.  A micro nerve hook was able to be passed up the foramen easily.  Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocautery and Surgiflo.  The end plates at C6-C7 were then prepared using a high-speed burr and then a 7-mm machined lordotic allograft was malleted into place.  There was good bony apposition, both proximally and distally.  Next, a 44-mm Blackstone low-profile anterior cervical plate was applied to the anterior cervical spine with six 14 mm screws.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed appropriate positioning of the plate and the graft.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with normal saline and bacitracin.  There was no active bleeding upon closure of the wound.  A small drain was placed deep.  The platysmal muscle was closed with 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with #4-0 Monocryl.  Mastisol and Steri-Strips were applied.  The patient was monitored throughout the procedure with free-running EMGs and SSEPs and there were no untoward events.

Following intubation, the patient's mouth was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a toothbrush following placement of a throat pack.  At that point, approximately 5 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:20,000 epinephrine was injected for a right inferior alveolar block, as well as local infiltration in the right long buccal nerve area as well as the right cheek area.  Local infiltration also was done near the tooth #32.  At this point, a periosteal elevator was used to loosen up the gingival tissue of the teeth #1, #29, and #32; and all 3 teeth were extracted using simple extraction, using elevators and forceps.  In addition, the previous Penrose drain was removed by removing the suture, and the incision that was used for I&D on the previous day was extended laterally.  A hemostat was used to puncture through to the right buccal space.  Approximately, 2.5 to 3 mL of purulence was drained, and that was used for Gram stain and culture, as mentioned above.  Following copious irrigation of the area, following the extraction and following the incision and drainage, 2 quarter-inch Penrose drains were placed in the anterior as well as the posterior section of the incision into the buccal space.

There was a pedunculated polyp approximately 4.5 cm in size located in the sigmoid colon at approximately 35 cm.  This large polyp was removed using the snare technique.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the endoscopy suite, prepped and draped in left lateral decubitus position.  IV sedation was given by Anesthesia Department.  The Olympus videoscope was inserted into anus.  Using air insufflation, the colonoscope was advanced through the anus to the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon and cecum, the above gross findings were noted.  The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and carefully examined the lumen of the bowel.  When the polyp again was visualized, the snare was passed around the polyp.  It required at least two to three passes of the snare to remove the polyp in its totality.  There was a large stalk on the polyp.  ________ the polyp had been removed down to the junction of the polyp in the stalk, which appeared to be cauterized and no residual adenomatous tissue was present.  No bleeding was identified.  The colonoscope was then removed and patient was sent to recovery room in stable condition.",Gastroenterology

4482,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  ,Followup of seizures.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 47-year-old African-American female, well known to the neurology service, who has been referred to me for the first time evaluation of her left temporal lobe epilepsy that was diagnosed in August of 2002.  At that time, she had one generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  Apparently she had been having several events characterized by confusion and feeling unsteady lasting for approximately 60 seconds.  She said these events were very paroxysmal in the sense they suddenly came on and would abruptly stop.  She had two EEGs at that time, one on August 04, 2002 and second on November 01, 2002, both of which showed rare left anterior temporal sharp waves during drowsiness and sleep.  She also had an MRI done on September 05, 2002, with and without contrast that was negative.  Her diagnosis was confirmed by Dr. X at Johns Hopkins Hospital who reviewed her studies as well as examined the patient and felt that actually her history and findings were consistent with diagnosis of left temporal lobe epilepsy.  She was initially started on Trileptal, but had some problems with the medication subsequently Keppra, which she said made her feel bad and subsequently changed in 2003 to lamotrigine, which she has been taking since then.  She reports no seizures in the past several years.  She currently is without complaint.,In terms of seizure risk factors she denies head trauma, history of CNS infection, history of CVA, childhood seizures, febrile seizures.  There is no family history of seizures.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant only for hypertension and left temporal lobe epilepsy.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Remarkable only for hypertension in her father.  Her mother died in a motor vehicle accident.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She works running a day care at home.  She has three children.  She is married.  She does not smoke, use alcohol or illicit drugs.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Please see note in chart.

2779,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Large and invasive recurrent pituitary adenoma.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Endoscopic-assisted transsphenoidal exploration and radical excision of pituitary adenoma, endoscopic exposure of sphenoid sinus with removal of tissue from within the sinus, harvesting of dermal fascia abdominal fat graft, placement of abdominal fat graft into sella turcica, reconstruction of sellar floor using autologous nasal bone creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm, repair of nasal septal deviation, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique, and placement of lumbar subarachnoid catheter connected to reservoir for aspiration and infusion.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This man has undergone one craniotomy and 2 previous transsphenoidal resections of his tumor, which is known to be an invasive pituitary adenoma.  He did not return for followup or radiotherapy as instructed, and the tumor has regrown.  For this reason, he is admitted for transsphenoidal reoperation with an attempt to remove as much tumor as possible.  The high-risk nature of the procedure and the fact that postoperative radiation is mandatory was made clear to him.  Many risks including CSF leak and blindness were discussed in detail.  After clear understanding of all the same, he elected to proceed ahead with surgery.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating table, and after adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The back was prepped and draped in usual sterile manner.,A 14-gauge Tuohy needle was introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space.  Clear and colorless CSF issued forth.  A catheter was inserted to a distance of 40 cm, and the needle was removed.  The catheter was then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion.,This no-touch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patients with large invasive adenomas.  Via injections through the lumbar drain, one increases intracranial pressure and produces gentle migration of the tumor.  This improves outcome and reduces complications by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus.,The patient was then placed supine, and the 3-point headrest was affixed.  He was placed in the semi-sitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The fluoroscope C-arm unit was then positioned so as to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection.  The metallic arm was then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope.  The oropharynx, nasopharynx, and abdominal areas were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made in the abdominal region, and several large pieces of fat were harvested for later use.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The wound was carefully closed in layers.,I then advanced a 0-degree endoscope up the left nostril.  The middle turbinate was identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium.  Needle Bovie electrocautery was used to clear mucosa away from the ostium.  The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid.  I entered into the sphenoid.,There was a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present, and I slowly and carefully worked through all this.  I identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone, which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left, which was very well exposed, and the cavernous sinus on the right, which I exposed the very medial portion of.  The opening was wide until I had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present.,The operating microscope was then utilized.  Working under magnification, I used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril.,The dura was then carefully opened in the midline, and I immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma.  A frozen section was obtained, which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant features.,Slowly and meticulously, I worked to remove the tumor.  I used the suction apparatus as well as the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free.  The tumor was moderately vascular and very fibrotic.,Slowly and carefully, I systematically entered the sellar contents until I could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right.  There appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left.  It was consistent with what we saw on the MRI imaging.,The portion working into the suprasellar cistern was slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter.  A large amount of this was removed.  There was a CSF leak, as the tumor was removed for the upper surface of it was very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free.,Under high magnification, I actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor.  While there may be a small amount of tumor remaining, it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus.  In fact, I reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well.,I reasoned that I had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression.  Attention was therefore turned to closure.,The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution, and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  I asked Anesthesiology to perform a Valsalva maneuver, and there was no evidence of bleeding.,Attention was turned to closure and reconstruction.  I placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there was no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air.  Using a polypropylene insert, I reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm.,DuraSeal was placed over this, and the sphenoid sinus was carefully packed with fat and DuraSeal.,I inspected the nasal passages and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation.  The middle turbinates were then restored to their anatomic position.  There was no significant intranasal bleeding, and for this reason, an open nasal packing was required.  Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left to the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct, and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of tumor.",Neurology
4962,"DIAGNOSIS: , Aortic valve stenosis with coronary artery disease associated with congestive heart failure.  The patient has diabetes and is morbidly obese.,PROCEDURES: , Aortic valve replacement using a mechanical valve and two-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure using saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery and left radial artery graft to the left anterior descending artery.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal,INCISION: , Median sternotomy,INDICATIONS: , The patient presented with severe congestive heart failure associated with the patient's severe diabetes.  The patient was found to have moderately stenotic aortic valve.  In addition, The patient had significant coronary artery disease consisting of a chronically occluded right coronary artery but a very important large obtuse marginal artery coming off as the main circumflex system.  The patient also has a left anterior descending artery which has moderate disease and this supplies quite a bit of collateral to the patient's right system.  It was decided to perform a valve replacement as well as coronary artery bypass grafting procedure.,FINDINGS: , The left ventricle is certainly hypertrophied· The aortic valve leaflet is calcified and a severe restrictive leaflet motion.  It is a tricuspid type of valve.  The coronary artery consists of a large left anterior descending artery which is associated with 60% stenosis but a large obtuse marginal artery which has a tight proximal stenosis.,The radial artery was used for the left anterior descending artery.  Flow was excellent.  Looking at the targets in the posterior descending artery territory, there did not appear to be any large branches.  On the angiogram these vessels appeared to be quite small.  Because this is a chronically occluded vessel and the patient has limited conduit due to the patient's massive obesity, attempt to bypass to this area was not undertaken.  The patient was brought to the operating room,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A median sternotomy incision was carried out and conduits were taken from the left arm as well as the right thigh.  The patient weighs nearly three hundred pounds.  There was concern as to taking down the left internal mammary artery.  Because the radial artery appeared to be a good conduit The patient would have arterial graft to the left anterior descending artery territory.  The patient was cannulated after the aorta and atrium were exposed and full heparinization.,The patient went on cardiopulmonary bypass and the aortic cross-clamp was applied Cardioplegia was delivered through the coronary sinuses in a retrograde manner.  The patient was cooled to 32 degrees.  Iced slush was applied to the heart.  The aortic valve was then exposed through the aortic root by transverse incision.  The valve leaflets were removed and the #23 St. Jude mechanical valve was secured into position by circumferential pledgeted sutures.  At this point, aortotomy was closed.,The first obtuse marginal artery was a very large target and the vein graft to this target indeed produced an excellent amount of flow.  Proximal anastomosis was then carried out to the foot of the aorta.  The left anterior descending artery does not have severe disease but is also a very good target and the radial artery was anastomosed to this target in an end-to-side manner.  The two proximal anastomoses were then carried out to the root of the aorta.,The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass after aortic cross-clamp was released.  The patient was adequately warmed.  Protamine was given without adverse effect.  Sternal closure was then done using wires.  The subcutaneous layers were closed using Vicryl suture.  The skin was approximated using staples.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

4908,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently who has had atrial flutter, who estimates he has had six cardioversions since 10/09, and estimates that he has had 12 to 24 in his life beginning in 2006 when the atrial fibrillation first emerged.  He, since 10:17 p.m. on 01/17/10, noted recurrence of his atrial fibrillation, called our office this morning, that is despite being on flecainide, atenolol, and he is maintained on Coumadin.,The patient has noted some lightheadedness as well as chest discomfort and shortness of breath when atrial flutter recurred and we see that on his 12-lead EKG here.  Otherwise, no chest pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and again he had atrial fibrillation more persistently in 2006, but more recently it has been atrial flutter and that is despite use of antiarrhythmics including flecainide.  He completed a stress test in my office within the past several weeks that was normal without evidence of ischemia.  Other medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia.,MEDICATIONS:,As outpatient,,1.  Atenolol 25 mg once a day.,2.  Altace 2.5 mg once a day.,3.  Zocor 20 mg once a day.,4.

HE DENIES SHRIMP, SEA FOOD OR DYE ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY: , He has a nephew who was his sister's son who passed away at age 22 reportedly from an MI, but was reported to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as well.  The patient has previously met with the electrophysiologist, Dr. X, at General Hospital and it sounds like he had a negative EP study.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol nor drink any caffeine.  No use of illicit drugs.  He has been married for 22 years and he is actually accompanied throughout today's cardiology consultation by his wife.  He is not participating in regular exercises now because he states since starting flecainide, he has gotten sluggish.  He is employed as an attorney and while he states that overall his mental stress is better, he has noted more recent mental stress this past weekend when he was taking his daughter back to college.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He denies any history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi.  There are some questions especially as his wife has told me that he may have obstructive sleep apnea and not had a formal sleep study.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , Blood pressure 156/93, pulse is 100, respiratory rate 18.  On general exam, he is a pleasant overweight gentleman, in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  He has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins are not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  Affect appropriate.  He is quite oriented and pleasant.  No significant kyphoscoliosis on recumbent back exam.

Abdomen is soft, nondistended, appears benign.  Extremities without significant edema.  Pulses grossly intact.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA:,  Initial ECG shows atrial flutter.,IMPRESSION: , Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so.  I have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of.  After in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was I primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as I did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of CVA, although we cannot really make that null.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis.  I invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient received a total of 7 mg of Versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the Medical Center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions.  The patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure.  After the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using ""lollipop posterior patch"" with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy.  There was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead EKG.,IMPRESSION: , Cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on Coumadin and his INR is 3.22.  We are going to watch him and discharge him from the Medical Center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, Coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed.  I had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, Dr. X, at Electrophysiology Unit at General Hospital and I will be planning to place a call for Dr. X myself.  Again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and I suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms.,I had previously discussed the case with Dr. Y who is the patient's general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient's bedside regarding our findings.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

The patient was placed in posterior splint and followed up at ABC orthopedics for further care.,PROCEDURE:,  After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedure were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, the operative surgeon, Department Of Anesthesia, and nursing staff.  While in this hospital, the Department Of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  The patient was then transferred to the operative table and placed in the prone position.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.,A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time.  Left lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Once this was done, the left lower extremity was elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg and kept up for a total of 40 minutes.  After all bony and soft tissue land marks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made paramedial to the Achilles tendon from its insertion proximal.  Careful dissection was then taken down to the level of the peritenon.  Once this was reached, full thickness flaps were performed medially and laterally.  Next, retractor was placed.  All neurovascular structures were protected.  A longitudinal incision was then made in the peritenon and opened up exposing the tendon.  There was noted to be complete rupture of the tendon approximately 4 cm proximal to the insertion point.  The plantar tendon was noted to be intact.  The tendon was debrided at this time of hematoma as well as frayed tendon.  Wound was copiously irrigated and dried.  Most of the ankle appeared that there was sufficient tendon links in order to do a primary repair.  Next #0 PDS on a taper needle was selected and a Krackow stitch was then performed.  Two sutures were then used and tied individually ________ from the tendon.  The tendon came together very well and with a tight connection.  Next, a #2-0 Vicryl suture was then used to close the peritenon over the Achilles tendon.  The wound was once again copiously irrigated and dried.  A #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to close the skin and subcutaneous fashion followed by #4-0 suture in the subcuticular closure on the skin.  Steri-Strips were then placed over the wound and the sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, Kerlix roll, sterile Kerlix and a short length fiberglass cast in a plantar position.  At this time, the Department of anesthesia reversed the anesthetic.  The patient was transferred back to hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen.  The hypopharynx appeared normal.  The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout its distance, but at the distal end, there was a moderate-sized hiatal hernia noted.  The GE junction was seen at 40 cm and the hiatus was noted at 44 cm from the incisors.  Above the GE junction, there were three fingers of columnar epithelium extending cephalad, to a distance of about 2 cm.  This appears to be consistent with Barrett esophagus.  Multiple biopsies were taken from numerous areas in this region.  There was no active ulceration or inflammation and no stricture.  The hiatal hernia sac had normal mucosa except for one small erosion at the hiatus.  The gastric body had normal mucosa throughout.  Numerous small fundic gland polyps were noted, measuring 3 to 5 mm in size with an entirely benign appearance.  Biopsies were taken from the antrum to rule out Helicobacter pylori.  A retroflex view of the cardia and fundus confirmed the small hiatal hernia and demonstrated no additional lesions.  The scope was passed through the pylorus, which was patent and normal.  The mucosa throughout the duodenum in the first, second, and third portions was entirely normal.  The scope was withdrawn and the patient was sent to the recovery room.

3096,"ALLOWED CONDITIONS:,  Left knee strain, meniscus tear left knee.,CONTESTED CONDITION:,  Osteoarthritis of the left knee.,EMPLOYER:,  ABCD.,I examined Xxxxx today September 14, 2007, for the above allowed conditions and also the contested condition of osteoarthritis of his left knee.  He is a 57-year-old assembly worker who was injured on June 13, 2007, which according to his FROI was due to ""repairing cars, down on knees to work on concrete floors.""  In addition, he slipped on an air hose on the floor at work on March 7, 2007, re-injuring his left knee.  He developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  He denies having any difficulties with his left knee prior to the injury of June 13, 2002.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , August 2, 2002, MRI of the left knee showed low-grade chondromalacia of the left patellofemoral joint space and a posterior horn tear of the medial meniscus, likely degenerative in nature, and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space.  On June 26, 2007, MRI of his left knee was referred to in the injury management report of June 19, 2007, as showing osteoarthritis of the medial compartment has advanced.  He brought with him copies of x-rays taken July 16, 2007, of his left knee, which I reviewed and which showed marked narrowing of the medial compartment of his left knee with spurs on the margins of the joint medially and also spurs on the patella.  There was subluxation of the tibia on the femur with standing.,After his injury, he received treatment from Dr. X for patellofemoral syndrome with knee sleeve.  He also received treatment from Dr. Y also for left knee sprain and patellar pain.  He also did exercise, does use a knee sleeve and Aleve.  On December 5, 2002, he underwent arthroscopy of the left knee by Dr. Z who did a partial resection of a torn medial meniscus.  He also noticed grade III chondromalacia of the patella as well as the torn medial meniscus.  He states that he was asymptomatic until he slipped on an air hose while at work on March 7, 2007, and again developed pain and swelling in his left knee.  Standing aggravates his pain.  He has had one injection of cortisone by Dr. Z about a month ago, which has helped his pain.  He takes one hydrocodone 7.5/750 mg daily.,Examination of his left knee revealed there was bilateral varus deformity, healed arthroscopy incisional scars, there was a 1/2 atrophy of the left calf.  There was patellar crepitus with knee motion.  There was no motor weakness or reflex changes.  He walked without a limp and could stand on his heels and toes equally well.  There was no instability of the knee and no effusion.  Range of motion was 0 to 120 degrees.,QUESTION: , Xxxxx has recently filed to reactivate this claim.  Please give me your opinion as to whether Xxxxx's current clinical presentation is related to the industrial injury stated above.,ANSWER:, Yes.  His original MRI of August 2, 2002, did show low-grade chondromalacia of the patellofemoral joint and also grade II to III chondromalacia of the medial joint space, which was the beginning of osteoarthritis.  Also, it is well known that torn medial meniscus can result in osteoarthritis of the knee; therefore, the osteoarthritis is related to his original injury of June 13, 2007, specifically to the torn medial meniscus.,QUESTION:  ,Do I believe that claim #123 should be reactivated to allow for treatment of the allowed conditions as stated?,ANSWER:, Yes, I believe it should be reactivated to allow treatment of the contested condition of osteoarthritis of his left knee.,QUESTION:,  Xxxxx has filed an application for additional allowance of osteoarthritis of the left knee.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records, and diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?,ANSWER: ,Yes.  Please see the discussion in the answer to question no one.  In addition, x-rays of July 16, 2007, do reveal medial compartment and patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritis of the left knee.,QUESTION: , If you find this condition exists, is it a direct and proximate result of the June 13, 2002, injury?,ANSWER:, Yes.  See discussion in answer to question number one.,QUESTION: , Do you find that Xxxxx's injury or disability was caused by the natural deterioration of tissue, an organ or part of body?,ANSWER: ,No.  I believe the osteoarthritis was the result of the torn medial meniscus as discussed under question number one.,QUESTION: , In addition, if you find the condition exists, are there non-occupational activities or intervening injuries, which could have contributed to Xxxxx's condition?,ANSWER:, No.  He does not give any history of any intervening injuries.,If you opine the requested condition should be additionally recognized, please include the condition as an allowed condition in the discussion of the following questions.,QUESTION:,  Based on the objective findings is the request for 10 sessions of physical therapy per C-9 dated July 27, 2007, medically necessary and appropriate for the allowed conditions of the claim of osteoarthritis of left knee?,ANSWER:,  Yes.,",IME-QME-Work Comp etc.

He presents today with diarrhea and bleeding.  Digital exam reveals bright red blood on the finger.  He is for exam under anesthesia and control of hemorrhage at this time.,FINDINGS: , There was an ulcer where most of the polypoid lesion had been excised before.  In a near total fashion the wound had opened and again there was a raw ulcer surface in between the edges of the mucosa.  There were a few discrete sites of mild oozing, which were treated with cautery and #1 suture.  No other obvious bleeding was seen.,TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operative table in supine position.  After adequate general anesthesia was induced, the patient was then placed in modified prone position.  His buttocks were taped, prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The anterior rectal wall was exposed using a Parks anal retractor.  The entire wound was visualized with a few rotations of the retractor and a few sites along the edges were seen to be oozing and were touched up with cautery.  There was one spot in the corner that was oozing and this may have been from simply opening the retractor enough to see well.  This was controlled with a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight suture.

The breasts were prepped and draped with DuraPrep and iodine solution and then draped in appropriate sterile fashion.  Markings were then made in the standing position preoperatively.  The nipple areolar complex was drawn at the level of the anterior projection of the inframammary fold along the central margin of the breast.  A McKissock ring was utilized as a pattern.  It was centered over the new nipple position and the medial and lateral flaps were drawn tangential to the pigmented areola at a 40-degree angle.  Medial and lateral flaps were drawn 8 cm in length.  At the most medial and lateral extremity inframammary folds, a line was drawn to the lower level at the medial and lateral flaps.  On the left side, the epithelialization was performed about the 45-mm nipple-areolar complex within the confines of the superior-medially based dermal parenchymal pedicle.  Resection of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and glandular tissue was performed along the inframammary fold, and then cut was made medially and laterally.  The resection medially was perpendicular to the chest wall down to the areolar tissue overlying the pectoralis major muscle, and laterally, the resection was performed tangential to the chest wall, skin, subcutaneous tissue, and glandular tissue towards the axillary tail.  The pedicle was thinned as well, so it was 2-cm thick beneath the nipple-areolar complex and they were medially 4-cm thick at its base.  On the right side, 947 g of breast tissue was removed.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  Identical procedure was performed on the opposite left side, again with a superiorly and inferiorly based dermal parenchymal pedicle with deepithelialization about the 45-mm diameter nipple-areolar complex.  Resection of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and glandular tissue was performed medially down to the chest overlying the pectoralis major muscle and laterally tangential to the chest wall towards the axillary tail setting the pedicle as well beneath the nipple areolar complex.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  With pedicle on the left, the breast issue on the left side was weighed at 758 g.  Hemostasis was achieved with cautery.  The patient was placed in the sitting position with wound partially closed and there appeared to be excellent symmetry between the right and left sides.  The nipple-areolar complex was transposed within the position and the medial and lateral flaps were brought together beneath the transposed nipple-areolar complex.  Closure was performed with interrupted 3-0 PDS suture for deep subcutaneous tissue and dermis.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl suture.  A Jackson-Pratt drain had been placed prior to final closure and secured with a 4-0 silk suture.  The wound had been irrigated prior to final closure as well with bacitracin irrigation solution prior to final cauterization.  Closure was performed with an anchor-shaped closure around the nipple-areolar complex, vertically of inframammary folds and across the inframammary folds.  Dressing was applied.  The suture line was treated with Dermabond.

Dissection was carried down through the fascia and the xiphoid was resected.  The sternum was retracted superiorly the pericardium was identified and pericardial fat was cleared off the pericardium.  An #0 silk suture was then placed into the pericardium with care taken not to enter the underlying heart.,This suture was used to retract the pericardium and the pericardium was nicked with #15 blade under direct visualization.  Serous fluid exited through the pericardium and was sent for culture, cytology, and cell count etc.  A section of pericardium was taken approximately 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm and was removed.  The heart was visualized and appeared to be contracting well with no evidence of injury to the heart.  The pericardium was then palpated.  There was no evidence of studding.  A right angle chest tube was then placed in the pericardium along the diaphragmatic of the pericardium and then brought out though a small skin incision in the epigastrium.  It was sewn into place with #0 silk suture.  There was some air leak of the left pleural cavity, so a right angle chest tube was placed in the left pleural cavity and brought out through a skin nick in the epigastrium.  It was sewn in the similar way to the other chest tube.  Once again, the area was inspected and found to be hemostatic and then closed with #0 Vicryl suture for fascial stitch, then #3-0 Vicryl suture in the subcutaneous fat, and then #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.

Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.,Neck:  Trachea appeared to be in the midline.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.,Cardiovascular:  Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.,Abdomen:  Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.,Extremities:  Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV.  There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout.  She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.,Neurological:  From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout.  Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation.  Her overall resting tone was normal.  Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.  Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements.  Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.,2.  As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.,3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.  The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.,4.  The patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks' time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then.",Consult - History and Phy.

Injection for myelogram.,2.  Microscopic-assisted lumbar laminectomy with discectomy at L5-S1 on the left on 08/28/03.,BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 25 cc.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,POSITION:,  Prone on the Jackson table.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  Extruded nucleus pulposus at the level of L5-S1.,HISTORY: , This is a 34-year-old male with history of back pain with radiation into the left leg in the S1 nerve root distribution.  The patient was lifting at work on 08/27/03 and felt immediate sharp pain from his back down to the left lower extremity.  He denied any previous history of back pain or back surgeries.  Because of his intractable pain as well as severe weakness in the S1 nerve root distribution, the patient was aware of all risks as well as possible complications of this type of surgery and he has agreed to pursue on.  After an informed consent was obtained, all risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient.  ,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,He was wheeled back to Operating Room #5 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/28/03.  After a general anesthetic was administered, a Foley catheter was inserted.,The patient was then turned prone on the Jackson table.  All of his bony prominences were well-padded.  At this time, a myelogram was then performed.  After the lumbar spine was prepped, a #20 gauge needle was then used to perform a myelogram.  The needle was localized to the level of L3-L4 region.  Once inserted into the thecal sac, we immediately got cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal needle.  At this time, approximately 10 cc of Conray injected into the thecal sac.  The patient was then placed in the reversed Trendelenburg position in order to assist with distal migration of the contrast.  The myelogram did reveal that there was some space occupying lesion, most likely disc at the level of L5-S1 on the left.  There was a lack of space filling defect on the left evident on both the AP and the lateral projections using C-arm fluoroscopy.  At this point, the patient was then fully prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure for a microdiscectomy.  A long spinal needle was then inserted into region of surgery on the right.  The surgery was going to be on the left.  Once the spinal needle was inserted, a localizing fluoroscopy was then used to assure appropriate location and this did confirm that we were at the L5-S1 nerve root region.  At this time, an approximately 2 cm skin incision was made over the lumbar region, dissected down to the deep lumbar fascia.  At this time, a Weitlaner was inserted.  Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  We further continued through the deep lumbar fascia and dissected off the short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process and the lamina.  A Cobb elevator was then used to elevate subperiosteally off of all the inserting short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process as well as the lamina on the left-hand side.  At this time, a Taylor retractor was then inserted and held there for retraction.  Suction as well as Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  At this time, a small Kerrison Rongeur was used to make a small lumbar laminotomy to expose our window for the nerve root decompression.  Once the laminotomy was performed, a small _______ curette was used to elevate the ligamentum flavum off of the thecal sac as well as the adjoining nerve roots.  Once the ligamentum flavum was removed, we immediately identified a piece of disc material floating around outside of the disc space over the S1 nerve root, which was compressive.  We removed the extruded disc with further freeing up of the S1 nerve root.  A nerve root retractor was then placed.  Identification of disc space was then performed.  A #15 blade was then inserted and small a key hole into the disc space was then performed with a #15 blade.  A small pituitary was then inserted within the disc space and more disc material was freed and removed.  The part of the annulus fibrosis were also removed in addition to the loose intranuclear pieces of disc.  Once this was performed, we removed the retraction off the nerve root and the nerve root appeared to be free with pulsatile visualization of the vasculature indicating that the nerve root was essentially free.,At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  We then performed another look to see if any loose pieces of disc were extruding from the disc space and only small pieces were evident and they were then removed with the pituitary rongeur.  At this time, a small piece of Gelfoam was then used to cover the exposed nerve root.  We did not have any dural leaks during this case.  #1-0 Vicryl was then used to approximate the deep lumbar fascia, #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the superficial lumbar fascia, and #4-0 running Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Sterile dressings were then applied.  The patient was then carefully slipped over into the supine position, extubated and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.  At this time, we are still waiting to assess the patient postoperatively to assure no neurological sequela postsurgically are found and also to assess his pain level.",Neurosurgery

Recommendation for reversal of the colostomy was made after more than six months from the previous surgery for a sigmoid colon resection and Hartmann's colostomy.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room placed into lithotomy position after being prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A cystoscope was introduced into the patient's urethra and to the bladder.  Immediately, no evidence of cystitis was seen and the scope was introduced superiorly, measuring the bladder and immediately a #5 French ____ was introduced within the left urethra.  The cystoscope was removed, a Foley was placed, and wide connection was placed attaching the left ureteral stent and Foley.  At this point, immediately the patient was re-prepped and draped and immediately after the ostomy was closed with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, immediately at this point, the abdominal wall was opened with a #10 blade Bard-Parker down with electrocautery for complete hemostasis through the midline.,The incision scar was cephalad due to the severe adhesions in the midline.  Once the abdomen was entered in the epigastric area, then massive lysis of adhesions was performed to separate the small bowel from the anterior abdominal wall.  Once the small bowel was completely free from the anterior abdominal wall, at this point, the ostomy was taken down with an elliptical incision with cautery and then meticulous dissection with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal wall, where a meticulous dissection was carried with Metzenbaum scissors to separate the entire ostomy from the abdominal wall.  Immediately at this point, the bowel was dropped within the abdominal cavity, and more lysis of adhesions was performed cleaning the left gutter area to mobilize the colon further down to have no tension in the anastomosis.  At this point, the rectal stump, where two previous sutures with Prolene were seen, were brought with hemostats.  The rectal stump was free in a 360 degree fashion and immediately at this point, a decision to perform the anastomosis was made.  First, a self-retaining retractor was introduced in the abdominal cavity and a bladder blade was introduced as well.  Blue towel was placed above the small bowel retracting the bowel to cephalad and at this point, immediately the rectal stump was well visualized, no evidence of bleeding was seen, and the towels were placed along the edges of the abdominal wound.  Immediately, the pursestring device was fired approximately 1 inch from the skin and on the descending colon, this was fired.  The remainder of the excess tissue was closed with Metzenbaum scissors and immediately after dilating #25 and #29 mushroom tip from the T8 Ethicon was placed within the colon and then #9-0 suture was tied.  Immediately from the anus, the dilator #25 and #29 was introduced dilating the rectum.  The #29 EEA was introduced all the way anteriorly to the staple line and this spike from the EEA was used to perforate the rectum and then the mushroom from the descending colon was attached to it.  The EEA was then fired.  Once it was fired and was removed, the pelvis was filled with fluid.  Immediately both doughnuts were ____ from the anastomosis.  A Doyen was placed in both the anastomosis.  Colonoscope was introduced.  No bubble or air was seen coming from the anastomosis.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  Pictures of the anastomosis were taken.  The scope then was removed from the patient's rectum.  Copious amount of irrigation was used within the peritoneal cavity.  Immediately at this point, all complete sponge and instrument count was performed.  First, the ostomy site was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl suture.  The peritoneum was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Then, the midline incision was closed with a loop PDS in cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad tight in the middle.  Subq tissue was copiously irrigated and the staples on the skin.,The iodoform packing was placed within the old ostomy site and then the staples on the skin as well.  The patient did tolerate the procedure well and will be followed during the hospitalization.  The left ureteral stent was removed at the end of the procedure.  _____ were performed.

Transferred to the recovery room.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 4-year-old with a history of sebaceous cyst.  The patient is undergoing PE tubes by Dr. X and I was asked to remove the cyst on the right lateral eyebrow.  I saw the patient in my clinic.  I explained to the mother in Spanish the risk and benefits.  Risk included but not limited to risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, need for future revision surgery.  We will proceed with the surgery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken into the operating room, placed in the supine position.  General anesthetic was administered.  A prophylactic dose of antibiotic was given.  The patient was prepped and draped in a usual manner.  The procedure began by infiltrating lidocaine with epinephrine around the cyst area.  Then, I proceeded with the help of a 15C blade to make an incision and remove a small wedge of tissue that includes a comedo point.  The incision was done superiorly then inferiorly to a full thickness and to the skin down to the cyst.  The cyst was detached of the surrounding structure with the help of blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  The wound was closed with 5-0 Vicryl deep dermal interrupted stitches and Dermabond.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications and transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  Sponge, needle, and instrument counts were completed at the end of the procedure.",Surgery
3302,"SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 44-year-old white female who is here today with multiple problems.  The biggest concern she has today is her that left leg has been swollen.  It is swollen for three years to some extent, but worse for the past two to three months.  It gets better in the morning when she is up, but then through the day it begins to swell again.  Lately it is staying bigger and she somewhat uncomfortable with it being so large.  The right leg also swells, but not nearly like the left leg.  The other problem she had was she has had pain in her shoulder and back.  These occurred about a year ago, but the pain in her left shoulder is of most concern to her.  She feels like the low back pain is just a result of a poor mattress.  She does not remember hurting her shoulder, but she said gradually she has lost some mobility.  It is hard time to get her hands behind her back or behind her head.  She has lost strength in the left shoulder.  As far as the blood count goes, she had an elevated white count.  In April of 2005, Dr. XYZ had asked Dr. XYZ to see her because of the persistent leukocytosis; however, Dr. XYZ felt that this was not a problem for the patient and asked her to just return here for follow up.  She also complains of a lot of frequency with urination and nocturia times two to three.  She has gained weight; she thinks about 12 pounds since March.  She now weighs 284.  Fortunately, her blood pressure is staying stable.  She takes atenolol 12.5 mg per day and takes Lasix on a p.r.n. basis, but does not like to take it because it causes her to urinate so much.  She denies chest pain, but she does feel like she is becoming gradually more short of breath.  She works for the city of Wichita as bus dispatcher, so she does sit a lot, and just really does not move around much.  Towards the end of the day her leg was really swollen.  I reviewed her lab work.  Other than the blood count her lab work has been pretty normal, but she does need to have a cholesterol check.,OBJECTIVE:,General:  The patient is a very pleasant 44-year-old white female quite obese.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure:  122/70.  Temperature:  98.6.,HEENT:  Head:  Normocephalic.  Ears:  TMs intact.  Eyes:  Pupils round, and equal.  Nose:  Mucosa normal.  Throat:  Mucosa normal.,Lungs:  Clear.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.,Abdomen:  Soft and obese.,Extremities:  A lot of fluid in both legs, but especially the left leg is really swollen.  At least 2+ pedal edema.  The right leg just has a trace of edema.  She has pain in her low back with range of motion.  She has a lot of pain in her left shoulder with range of motion.  It is hard for her to get her hand behind her back.  She cannot get it up behind her head.  She has pain in the anterior left shoulder in that area.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Multiple problems including left leg swelling.,2.  History of leukocytosis.,3.  Joint pain involving the left shoulder, probably impingement syndrome.,4.  Low back pain, chronic with obesity.,5.  Obesity.,6.  Frequency with urination.,7.  Tobacco abuse.,PLAN:,1.  I will schedule for a venous Doppler of the left leg and will have her come back in the morning for a CBC and a metabolic panel.  We will start her on Detrol 0.4 mg one daily and also started on Mobic 15 mg per day.,2.  Elevate her leg as much as possible and wear support hose if possible.  Keep her foot up during the day.  We will see her back in two weeks.  We will have the results of the Doppler, the lab work and see how she is doing with the Detrol and the joint pain.  If her shoulder pain is not any better, we probably should refer her on over to orthopedist.  We did do x-rays of her shoulder today that did not show anything remarkable.  See her in two weeks or p.r.n.",General Medicine

The leg was exsanguinated by gravity and pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.,A straight anterior incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Unilateral flaps were developed and a median retinacular parapatellar incision was made. The extensor mechanism was partially divided and the patella was everted. Some of the femoral bone spurs were resected using an osteotome and a rongeur. Ascending drill hole was made in the distal femur and the distal femoral cut, anterior and posterior and chamfer cuts were accomplished for a 67.5 femoral component.,At this point the ACL was resected. Some of the fat pad and synovium were resected, as well as both medial and lateral menisci. A posterior cruciate retractor was utilized, the tibia brought forward and a centering drill hole made in the tibia. The intramedullary guide was used for cutting the tibia. It was set at 8 mm. An additional 2 mm was resected because of a moderate defect medially.,A trial reduction was done with a 71 tibial baseplate. This was pinned and drilled and then trial reduction done with a 10-mm insert.,This gave good stability and a full range of motion.,The patella was measured with the calibers and 9 mm of bone was resected with an oscillating saw. A 34-mm component was drilled for.,A further trial reduction was done and two liters of pulse lavage were used to clean the bony surfaces. A packet of cement was hand mixed, pressurized with a spatula into the proximal tibia. Multiple drill holes were made on the medial side of the tibia where the bone was somewhat sclerotic. The tibia baseplate was secured and the patella was inserted, held with a clamp. The extraneous cement was removed. At this point the tibial baseplate was locked into place and the femoral component also seated solidly.,The knee was extended, held in this position for another 5-6 minutes until the cement was cured. Further extraneous cement was removed. The pneumatic tourniquet was released, hemostasis was obtained with electrocoagulation.,Retinaculum, quadriceps and extensor were repaired with multiple figure-of-eight #1 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissue with 2-0 and the skin with skin staples.

He had required ventilator assistance and was transported to the ICU setting.  Because of the numerous deficits from the stroke, he is expected to have a prolonged ventilatory course and he will be requiring long-term care.,PROCEDURE: , After all risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with multiple family members in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operative Suite where he was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered through the existing endotracheal tube.  The neck was then palpated and marked appropriately in the cricoid cartilage sternal notch and thyroid cartilage marked appropriately with felt-tip marker.  The skin was then anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The surgeons were gowned and gloved.  A vertical skin incision was then made with a #15 blade scalpel extending from approximately two fingerbreadths above the level of the sternum approximately 1 cm above the cricoid cartilage.  Blunt dissection was then carried down until the fascia overlying the strap muscles were identified.  At this point, the midline raphe was identified and the strap muscles were separated utilizing the Bovie cautery.  Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration.  A high-riding innominate was not identified.  At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized.  Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery.  Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion.  This cleared a significant portion of the trachea.  The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery.  Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea.  The second tracheal ring was identified.  The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based.  At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff.  The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created.  The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified.  At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen.  The balloon was inflated and the ventilator was attached.  He was immediately noted to have return of the CO2 waveform and was ventilating appropriately according to the anesthetist.  Now, all surgical retractors were removed.  The baseplate of the tracheostomy tube was sutured to the patient's skin with #2-0 nylon suture.  The tube was further secured around the patient's neck with IV tubing.  Finally, a drain sponge was placed.  At this point, procedure was felt to be complete.

Imaging study showed that the distal hardware at the plate itself had fractured consistent with incomplete fusion across her osteomyelitis area.  There was no evidence of infection on the imaging or with her laboratory studies.  In addition, she developed a pretty profound stenosis at L4-L5 and L5-S1 that appeared to be recurrent as well.  She now presents for revision of her hardware, extension of fusion, and decompression.,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  She was placed on the operative table in the prone position.  Back was prepared with Betadine, iodine, and alcohol.  We elliptically excised her old incision and extended this caudally so that we had access from the existing hardware fixation all the way down to her sacrum.  The locking nuts were removed from the screw post and both plates refractured or significantly weakened and had a crease in it.  After these were removed, it was obvious that the bottom screws were somewhat loosened in the pedicle zone so we actually tightened one up and that fit good snugly into the nail when we redirected so that it actually reamed up into the upper aspect of the vertebral body in much more secure purchase.  We then dressed the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels which were profoundly stenotic.  This was a combination of scar and overgrown bone.  She had previously undergone bilateral hemilaminectomies at L4-5 so we removed scar bone and actually cleaned and significantly decompressed the dura at both of these levels.  After completing this, we inserted the Capstone interbody spacer filled with morselized autograft bone and some BMP sponge into the disk space at both levels.  We used 10 x 32 mm spacers at both L4-L5 and L5-S1.  This corrected the deformity and helped to preserve the correction of the stenosis and then after we cannulated the pedicles of L4, L5 and S1 tightened the pedicle screws in L3.  This allowed us to actually seat a 20 cm plate contoured to the lumbar lordosis onto the pedicle screws all the way from S1 up to the T11 level.  Once we placed the plate onto the screws and locked them in position, we then packed the remaining BMP sponge and morselized autograft bone through the plate around the incomplete fracture healing at the L1 level and then dorsolaterally at L4-L5 and L5-S1 and L3-L4, again the goal being to create a dorsal fusion and enhance the interbody fusion as well.  The wound was then irrigated copiously with bacitracin solution and then we closed in layers using #1 Vicryl in muscle and fascia, 3-0 in subcutaneous tissue and approximated staples in the skin.  Prior to closing the skin, we confirmed correct sponge and needle count.  We placed a drain in the extrafascial space and then confirmed that there were no other foreign bodies.  The Cell Saver blood was recycled and she was given two units of packed red blood cells as well.  I was present for and performed the entire procedure myself or supervised.",Neurosurgery

Nerve root decompression at L45 on the left side.,2.  Tun-L catheter placement with injection of steroid solution and Marcaine at L45 nerve roots left.,3.  Interpretation of radiograph.,ANESTHESIA: , IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  None.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: , Severe and excruciating pain in the lumbar spine and lower extremity.  MRI shows disc pathology as well as facet arthrosis.,SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was admitted to the operating room, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and four sterile towels.  After the towels were places then sterile drapes were placed on top of that.,After which time the Epimed catheter was then placed, this was done by first repositioning the C-Arm to visualize the lumbar spine and the vertebral bodies were then counted beginning at L5, verifying the sacral hiatus.  The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.,An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed® Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.  This verified positive nerve root decompression.  The tip of the Epimed Tun L catheter was noted to be at L45 level on the left side.  Positive myelogram without dural puncture was noted during this procedure; no sub-dural spread of Omnipaque 240 dye was noted.  This patient did not report any problems and reported pain reduction.",Surgery

Informed consent was obtained from the patient.  All risks, benefits and alternatives regarding the surgery have been reviewed in detail with the patient.  This includes risks of bleeding, infection, scarring, recurrence of lesion, need for further procedures, etc.  Each of the areas was cleaned with a sterile alcohol swab.  Planned excision site was marked with a marking pen.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated.  Sterile prep and drape were then performed.,We began first with excision of the left temple followed by the left nasolabial and right temple lesions.  The left temple lesion is noted to be a dark black what appears to be a keratotic or possible seborrheic keratotic neoplasm.  However, it is somewhat deeper than the standard seborrheic keratosis.  The incision for removal of this lesion was placed within the relaxed skin tension line of the left temple region.

Tonsillectomy and resection of soft palate.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,INDICATIONS: , Chris is a very nice 38-year-old male with nasal septal deviation and bilateral inferior turbinate hypertrophy causing nasal obstruction.  He also has persistent tonsillitis with hypertrophy and tonsillolith and halitosis.  He also has developed tremendous edema to his posterior palate and uvula, which is causing choking.  Correction of these mechanical abnormalities is indicated.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, the right and left nasal septal mucosa and right and left inferior turbinates were anesthetized with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine using approximately 10 mL.  Afrin-soaked pledgets were placed in the nasal cavity bilaterally.  The face was prepped with pHisoHex and draped in a sterile fashion.  A hemitransfixion incision was performed on the left with a #15 blade and submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  Anterior to the septal deflection, the septal cartilage was incised and an opposite-sided submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  The deviated portion of the nasal septal cartilage and bone was removed with a Takahashi forceps, and a large inferior septal spur was removed with a V-chisel.  Once the septum was reduced in the midline, the hemitransfixion incision was closed with a 4-0 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion.  The right and left inferior turbinates were trimmed in a submucous fashion using straight and curved turbinate scissors under direct visualization with a 4 mm 0 degree Storz endoscope.  Hemostasis was acquired by using suction electrocautery.  The turbinates were then covered with bacitracin ointment after cauterizing them and bacitracin ointment soaked Doyle splints were placed in the right and left nares and secured anteriorly to the columella with a 3-0 nylon suture.  The table was then turned.  A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was draped in a clean fashion.  A McIvor mouth gag was applied.  The tongue was retracted and the McIvor was gently suspended from the Mayo stand.  The left tonsil was grasped with a curved Allis forceps, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using a Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The right tonsil was grasped in a similar fashion, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The inferior, middle, and superior pole vessels were further cauterized with suction electrocautery.  The extremely edematous portion of soft palate was resected using a right angle clamp and right angle scissor and was closed with 3-0 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight interrupted fashion.  Copious saline irrigation of the oral cavity was then performed.  There was no further identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  The estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.",Surgery
4458,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and possible metabolic syndrome.  The patient reports that she has worked hard for a number of weeks following the meal plan prescribed, but felt like she was gaining weight and not losing weight on it.  She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.  However she realizes that the South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for her and so is coming back for better instruction on safe weight loss and low-fat eating.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 275 pounds.  Food records were reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient experienced a weight gain of 2 pounds since our last consultation which was two months ago.  I did carefully review her food records and evaluated calories consumed.  While she was carefully tracking the volume of protein and carbohydrates, she was getting some excess calories from the fatty proteins selected.  Thus we rearranged her meal plan a little bit and talked about how to track her fat calories as well.  She was more open to reducing the amount of protein from the previous meal plan and increasing slightly the amount of carbohydrates.  While this still is not as much carbohydrate as I would normally recommend, I am certainly willing to work with her on how she feels her body best handles weight reduction.  We also discussed a snack that could be eliminated in the morning because she really is not hungry at that time.,PLAN:,  A new 1500 calorie meal plan was developed based on 35% of the calories coming from protein, 40% of the calories from carbohydrate, and 25% of the calories from fat.  This translates in to 10 servings at 15 grams a piece of carbohydrates throughout the day dividing them in to groups of two servings per meal and per snack.  This also translates in to 2 ounces of protein at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.  We have eliminated the morning snack.  The patient will now track the grams of fat in her meats as well as added fats.  Her goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams of fat per day.  This was a half hour consultation.  We will plan to see the patient back in one month for support.",Consult - History and Phy.
2850,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 35-year-old woman who reports that on the 30th of October 2008, she had a rupture of her membranes at nine months of pregnancy, and was admitted to hospital and was given an epidural anesthetic.  I do not have the records from this hospital admission, but apparently the epidural was administered for approximately 14 to 18 hours.  She was sitting up during the epidural.,She did not notice any difference in her lower extremities at the time she had the epidural; however, she reports that she was extremely sleepy and may not have been aware of any change in strength or sensation in her lower extremities at that time.  She delivered on the 31st of October, by Cesarean section, because she had failed to progress and had pyrexia.,She also had a Foley catheter placed at that time.  On the 1st of November 2008, they began to mobilize her and it was at that time that she first noticed that she could not walk.  She was aware that she could not move her legs at all, and then within a few days, she was aware that she could move toes in the left foot but could not move her right foot at all.  Since that time, there has been a gradual improvement in strength to the point that she now has limited movement in her left leg and severely restricted movement in her right leg.  She is not able to walk by herself, and needs assistance to stand.  She was discharged from hospital after the Cesarean section on the 3rd of November.  Unfortunately, we do not have the records and we do not know what the discussion was between the anesthesiologist and the patient at the time of discharge.  She was then seen at ABC Hospital on November 05, 2008.  She had an MRI scan of her spine, which showed no evidence of an abnormality, specifically there were no cord changes and no evidence of a hematoma.  She also had an EMG study at that time by Dr. X, which was abnormal but not diagnostic and this was repeated again in December.  At the present time, she also complains of a pressure in both her legs and in her thighs.  She complains that her right foot hurts and that she has some hyperesthesia there.  She has been taking gabapentin to try to reduce the discomfort, although she is on a very low dose and the effect is minimal.  She has no symptoms in her arms, her bowel and bladder function is normal, and her bulbar function is normal.  There is no problem with her vision, swallowing, or respiratory function.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Unremarkable except as noted above.  She has seasonal allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Gabapentin 300 mg b.i.d., Centrum once a day, and another multivitamin.,ALLERGIES: , She has no medication allergies, but does have seasonal allergies.,FAMILY HISTORY: , There is a family history of diabetes and hypertension.  There is no family history of a neuropathy or other neurological disease.  She has one child, a son, born on October 31, 2008.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient is a civil engineer, who currently works from home.  She is working approximately half time because of limitations imposed on her by her disability, need to attend frequent physical therapy, and also the needs of looking after her baby.  She does not smoke and does not drink and has never done either.,GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  P 74, BP 144/75, and a pain score of 0.,GENERAL:  Her general physical examination was unremarkable.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal first and second heart sound, regular pulse with normal volume.,RESPIRATORY:  Unremarkable, both lung bases were clear, and respiration was normal.,GI:  Unremarkable, with no organomegaly and normal bowel sounds.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:,MSE:  The patient's orientation was normal, fund of knowledge was normal, memory was normal, speech was normal, calculation was normal, and immediate and long-term recall was normal.  Executive function was normal.,CRANIAL NERVES:  The cranial nerve examination II through XII was unremarkable.  Both disks were normal, with normal retina.  Pupils were equal and reactive to light.  Eye movements were full.  Facial sensation and strength was normal.  Bulbar function was normal.  The trapezius had normal strength.,MOTOR:  Muscle tone showed a slight increase in tone in the lower extremities, with normal tone in the upper extremities.  Muscle strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups in the upper extremities.  In the lower extremities, the hip flexors were 1/5 bilaterally, hip extensors were 1/5 bilaterally, knee extension on the right was 1/5 and on the left was 3-/5, knee flexion was 2/5 on the right and 3-/5 on the left, foot dorsiflexion was 0/5 on the right and 1/5 on the left, foot plantar flexion was 4-/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left, toe extension was 0/5 on the right and 4-/5 on the left, toe flexion was 4-/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left.,REFLEXES:  Reflexes in the upper extremities were 2+ bilaterally.  In the lower extremities, they were 0 bilaterally at the knee and ankles.  The abdominal reflexes were present above the umbilicus and absent below the umbilicus.  The plantar responses were mute.  The jaw reflex was normal.,SENSATION:  Vibration was moderately decreased in the right great toe and was mildly decreased in the left great toe.  There was a sensory level to light touch at approximately T7 posteriorly and approximately T9 anteriorly.  There was a range of sensation, but clearly there was a decrease in sensation below this level but not complete loss of sensation.  To pain, the sensory level is even less clear, but appeared to be at about T7 on the right side.  In the lower extremities, there was a slight decrease in pin and light touch in the right great toe compared to the left.  There was no evidence of allodynia or hyperesthesia.  Joint position sense was mildly reduced in the right toe and normal on the left.,COORDINATION:  Coordination for rapid alternating movements and finger-to-nose testing was normal.  Coordination could not be tested in the lower extremities.,GAIT:  The patient was unable to stand and therefore we were unable to test gait or Romberg's.  There was no evidence of focal back tenderness.,REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RECORDS: , I have reviewed the records from ABC Hospital, including the letter from Dr. Y and the EMG report dated 12/17/2008 from Dr. X. The EMG report shows evidence of a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy below approximately T6.  The lower extremity sensory responses are essentially normal; however, there is a decrease in the amplitude of the motor responses with minimal changes in latency.  I do have the MRI of lumbar spine report from 11/06/2008 with and without contrast.  This showed a minimal concentric disc bulge of L4-L5 without disc herniation, but was otherwise unremarkable.  The patient brought a disc with a most recent MRI study; however, we were unable to open this on our computers.  The verbal report is that the study was unremarkable except for some gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots.  A Doppler of the lower extremities showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.  Chest x-ray showed some scoliosis on the lumbar spine, curve to the left, but no evidence of other abnormalities.  A CT pelvis study performed on November 07, 2008 showed some nonspecific fluid in the subcutaneous fat of the back, posterior to L4 and L5 levels; however, there were no pelvic masses or other abnormalities.  We were able to obtain an update of the report from the MRI of the lumbar spine with and without contrast dated 12/30/2008.  The complete study included the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine.  There was diffuse enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina that had increased in enhancement since prior exam in November.  It was also reported that the patient was given intravenous methylprednisolone and this had had no effect on strength in her lower extremities.,IMPRESSION: , The patient has a condition that is temporarily related to the epidural injection she was given at the end of October 2008, prior to her Cesarean section.  It appears she became aware of weakness within two days of the administration of the epidural, she was very tired during the epidural and may have missed some change in her neurological function.  She was severely weak in both lower extremities, slightly worse on the right than the left.  There has been some interval improvement in her strength since the beginning of November 2008.  Her EMG study from the end of December is most consistent with a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy.  The MRI findings of gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots would be most consistent with an inflammatory radiculitis most likely related to the epidural anesthesia or administration of the epidural.  There had been no response to IV methylprednisolone given to her at ABC.  The issue of having a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of inflammatory cells or an elevated protein had been discussed with her at both ABC and by myself.  The patient did not wish to consider a lumbar puncture because of concerns that this might worsen her condition.  At the present time, she is able to stand with aid but is unable to walk.  There is no evidence on her previous EMG of a demyelinating neuropathy.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  The diagnostic issues were discussed with the patient at length.  She is informed that this is still early in the course of the problem and that we expect her to show some improvement in her function over the next one to two years, although it is unclear as to how much function she will regain.,2.  She is strongly recommended to continue with vigorous physical therapy, and to continue with the plan to mobilize her as much as possible, with the goal of trying to get her ambulatory.  If she is able to walk, she will need bilateral AFOs for her ankles, to improve her overall mobility.  I am not prescribing these because at the present time she does not need them.,3.  We discussed increasing the dose of gabapentin.  The paresthesias that she has may indicate that she is actually regaining some sensory function, although there is a concern that as recovery continues, she may be left with significant neuropathic pain.  If this is the case, I have advised her to increase her gabapentin dose from 300 mg b.i.d. gradually up to 300 mg four times a day and then to 600 mg to 900 mg four times a day.  She may need other neuropathic pain medications as needed.  She will determine whether her current symptoms are significant enough to require this increase in dosage.,4.  The patient will follow up with Dr. Y and his team at ABC Hospital.  She will also continue with physical therapy within the ABC system.",Neurology
382,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Same.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Radical resection of tumor of the scalp (CPT 11643).  Excision of tumor from the skull with debridement of the superficial cortex with diamond bur.  Advancement flap closure, with total undermined area 18 centimeters by 16 centimeters (CPT 14300).,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal anesthesia.,INDICATIONS:  ,This is an 81-year-old male who has a large exophytic 7cm lesion of the anterior midline scalp which is biopsy-positive for skin malignancy, specifically, squamous call carcinoma.  This appears to be affixed to the underlying scalp.,PLAN: , Radical resection with frozen sections to clear margins thereafter, with planned reconstruction.,CONSENT:,  I have discussed with the patient the possible risks of bleeding, infection, renal problems, scar formation, injury to muscle, nerves, and possible need for additional surgery with possible recurrence of the patient's carcinoma, with review of detailed informed consent with the patient, who understood, and wished to proceed.,FINDINGS: , The patient had a 7cm large exophytic lesion which appeared to be invasive into the superficial table of the skull.  The final periosteal margin which centrally appeared was positive for carcinoma.  The final margins peripherally were all negative.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and there was placed supine on the operating room table.,General endotracheal anesthesia was administered after endotracheal tube intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Service personnel.  The patient was thereafter prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using Betadine Scrub and Betadine paint.  Thereafter, the local anesthesia was injected into the area around the tumor.  A **** type excision was planned down to the periosteum.  A supraperiosteal radical resection was performed.,It was obvious that there was tumor at the deep margin, involving the periosteum.  The edges were marked along the four quadrants, at the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and the 9 o'clock positions, and these were sent for frozen section evaluation.  Frozen section revealed positive margins at one end of the resection.  Therefore, an additional circumferential resection was performed and the final margins were all negative.,Following completion, the deep periosteal margin was resected.  The circumferential periosteal margins were noted to be negative; however, centrally, there was a small area which showed tumor eroding into the superficial cortex of the skull.  Therefore, the Midas Rex drill was utilized to resect approximately 1-2 mm of the superficial cortex of the bone at the area where the positive margin was located.  Healthy bone was obtained; however, it did not enter the diploic or marrow-containing bone in the area.  Therefore, no bong margin was taken.  However, at the end of the procedure, it did not appear that the residual bone had any residual changes consistent with carcinoma.,Following completion of the bony resection, the area was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.

Xylocaine 1% was administered and a transverse antecubital incision was made over the venous limb of the graft, which was dissected out and encircled with a vessel loop.  The runoff vein was dissected out and encircled with the vessel loop as well.  A longitudinal incision was made over the venous anastomosis.  There was a narrowing in the area and slightly the incision was extended more proximally.  There was good back bleeding from the vein as well as bleeding from the more distal vein.  These were occluded with noncrushing DeBakey clamps and the patient was given 5000 units of heparin intravenously.  A #4 Fogarty was used to extract thrombus from the graft systematically until the arterial plug was removed and excellent inflow was established.  There was a narrowing in the mid portion of the venous limb of the graft, which was dilated with a #5 coronary dilator.  The Fogarty catheter was then passed up the vein, but no clot was obtained.  A patch PTFE material was fashioned and was sutured over the graftotomy with running 6-0 Gore-Tex suture.  Clamps were removed and flow established.  A thrill was easily palpable.  Hemostasis was achieved and the wound was irrigated and closed with 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous suture followed by 4-0 nylon on the skin.  A sterile dressing was applied.

The information gathered was based on the patient's self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.,IMPRESSIONS: , Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode.",Consult - History and Phy.

History as well as signs and symptoms are consistent with acute appendicitis as was his CAT scan.  I evaluated the patient in the emergency room and recommended that he undergo the above-named procedure.  The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable with surgery.,FINDINGS: , Patient was found to have acute appendicitis with an inflamed appendix, which was edematous, but essentially no suppuration.,TECHNIQUE:  ,The patient was identified and then taken into the operating room, where after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion.  An infraumbilical incision was made and carried down by blunt dissection to the level of the fascia, which was grasped with an Allis clamp and two stay sutures of 2-0 Vicryl were placed on either side of the midline.  The fascia was tented and incised and the peritoneum entered by blunt finger dissection.  A Hasson cannula was placed and a pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg pressure was obtained.  Patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position, rotated to his left, whereupon under direct vision, the 12-mm midline as well as 5-mm midclavicular and anterior axillary ports were placed.  The appendix was easily visualized, grasped with a Babcock's.  A window was created in the mesoappendix between the appendix and the cecum and the Endo GIA was introduced and the appendix was amputated from the base of the cecum.  The mesoappendix was divided using the Endo GIA with vascular staples.  The appendix was placed within an Endo bag and delivered from the abdominal cavity.  The intra-abdominal cavity was irrigated.  Hemostasis was assured within the mesentery and at the base of the cecum.  All ports were removed under direct vision and then wounds were irrigated with saline antibiotic solution.  The infraumbilical defect was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl suture.  The remaining wounds were irrigated and then everything was closed subcuticular with 4-0 Vicryl suture and Steri-Strips.

3533,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Followup of laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a delightful baby girl, who is now nearly 8 months of age and had a tracheostomy for subglottic stenosis.  Laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy was done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty.  Dr. X is following The patient for this and currently plans are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of months to assist the status of her airway caliber.,The patient had a laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy on 10/05/2007.  She has done well since that time.  She has had some episodes of retching intermittently and these seemed to be unpredictable.  She also had some diarrhea and poor feeding tolerance about a week ago but that has also resolved.  The patient currently takes about 1 ounce to 1.5 ounce of her feedings by mouth and the rest is given by G-tube.  She seems otherwise happy and is not having an excessive amount of stools.  Her parents have not noted any significant problems with the gastrostomy site.,The patient's exam today is excellent.  Her belly is soft and nontender.  All of her laparoscopic trocar sites are healing with a normal amount of induration, but there is no evidence of hernia or infection.  We removed The patient's gastrostomy button today and showed her parents how to reinsert one without difficulty.  The site of the gastrostomy is excellent.  There is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema, and I am very happy with the overall appearance.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy.  Hopefully, the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal, and if she does well, allow decannulation in the future.  If she does require laryngotracheoplasty, the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure as well.,PLAN:  ,The patient will follow up as needed for problems related to gastrostomy.  We will see her when she comes in the hospital for endoscopic exams and possibly laryngotracheoplasty in the future.",Gastroenterology

No evidence of ectopic pregnancy.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room where general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  She was examined under anesthesia.  An 8-10 cm anteverted uterus was noted.  The patient was placed in the dorsal-lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, a sponge on a sponge stick was used in the place of a HUMI in order to not instrument the uterus in the event that this was a viable intrauterine pregnancy and this may be a desired intrauterine pregnancy.  Attention was then turned to the patient's abdomen where a 5-mm incision was made in the inferior umbilicus.  The abdominal wall was tented and VersaStep needle was inserted into the peritoneal cavity.  Access into the intraperitoneal space was confirmed by a decrease in water level when the needle was filled with water.  No peritoneum was obtained without difficulty using 4 liters of CO2 gas.  The 5-mm trocar and sleeve were then advanced in to the intraabdominal cavity and access was confirmed with the laparoscope.,The above-noted findings were visualized.  A 5-mm skin incision was made approximately one-third of the way from the ASI to the umbilicus at McBurney's point.  Under direct visualization, the trocar and sleeve were advanced without difficulty.  A third incision was made in the left lower quadrant with advancement of the trocar into the abdomen in a similar fashion using the VersaStep.  The peritoneal fluid was aspirated and sent for culture and wash and cytology.  The abdomen and pelvis were surveyed with the above-noted findings.  No active bleeding was noted.  No evidence of ectopic pregnancy was noted.  The instruments were removed from the abdomen under good visualization with good hemostasis noted.  The sponge on a sponge stick was removed from the vagina.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,The attending, Dr. X, was present and scrubbed for the entire procedure.",Surgery
3060,"Doctor's Address,Dear Doctor:,This letter is an introduction to my patient, A, who you will be seeing in the near future.  He is a pleasant gentleman with a history of Wilson's disease.  It has been treated with penicillamine.  He was diagnosed with this at age 14.  He was on his way to South Carolina for a trip when he developed shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest discomfort.  He went to the closest hospital that they were near in Randolph, North Carolina and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid rate.  He was admitted there and observed.  He converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and so he required no further interventions.  He was started on Lopressor, which he has tolerated well.  An echocardiogram was performed, which revealed mild-to-moderate left atrial enlargement.  Normal ejection fraction.  No other significant valvular abnormality.  He reported to physicians there that he had cirrhosis related to his Wilson's disease.  Therefore hepatologist was consulted.  There was a recommendation to avoid Coumadin secondary to his questionable significant liver disease, therefore he was placed on aspirin 325 mg once a day.,In discussion with Mr. A and review of his chart that I have available, it is unclear as to the status of his liver disease, however, he has never had a liver biopsy, so his diagnosis of cirrhosis that they were concerned about in North Carolina is in doubt.  His LFTs have remained normal and his copper level has been undetectable on his current dose of penicillamine.,I would appreciate your input into the long term management of his anticoagulation and also any recommendations you would have about rhythm control.  He is in normal sinus rhythm as of my evaluation of him on 06/12/2008.  He is tolerating his metoprolol and aspirin without any difficulty.  I guess the big question remains is what level of risk that is entailed by placing him on Coumadin therapy due to his potentially paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and evidence of left atrial enlargement that would place him in increased risk of recurrent episodes.,I appreciate your input regarding this friendly gentleman.  His current medicines include penicillamine 250 mg p.o. four times a day, metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day, and aspirin 325 mg a day.,If you have any questions regarding his care, please feel free to call me to discuss his case.  Otherwise, I will look forward to hearing back from you regarding his evaluation.  Thank you as always for your care of our patient.",Letters
4977,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , In short, the patient is a 55-year-old gentleman with long-standing morbid obesity, resistant to nonsurgical methods of weight loss with BMI of 69.7 with comorbidities of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, possible sleep apnea, and also osteoarthritis of the lower extremities.  He is also an ex-smoker.  He is currently smoking and he is planning to quit and at least he should do this six to eight days before for multiple reasons including decreasing the DVT, PE rates and marginal ulcer problems after surgery, which will be discussed later on. ,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On physical examination today, he weighs 514.8 pounds, he has gained 21 pounds since the last visit with us.  His pulse is 78, temperature is 97.5, blood pressure is 132/74.  Lungs are clear.  He is a pleasant gentleman with stigmata of supermorbid obesity expected of his size.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.

Lungs are clear.  S1, S2 is heard.  Regular rate and rhythm. ,DISCUSSION:,  I had a long talk with the patient about laparoscopic gastric bypass possible open including risks, benefits, alternatives, need for long-term followup, need to adhere to dietary and exercise guidelines.  I also explained to him complications including rare cases of death secondary to DVT, PE, leak, peritonitis, sepsis shock, multisystem organ failure, need for reoperations, need for endoscopy for bleeding or leak, operations which could be diagnostic laparoscopy, exploratory laparotomy, drainage procedure, gastrostomy, jejunostomy for feeding, bleeding requiring blood transfusion, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, rarely tracheostomy, rare cases of renal failure requiring dialysis, etc., were all discussed. ,All these are going to be at high risk for this patient secondary to his supermorbid obese condition. ,I also explained to him specific gastric bypass related complications including gastrojejunal stricture requiring endoscopic dilatation, marginal ulcer secondary to smoking or antiinflammatory drug intake, which can progress on to perforation or bleeding, small bowel obstruction secondary to internal hernia or adhesions, signs and symptoms of which are described, so the patient could alert us for earlier intervention, symptomatic gallstone formation during rapid weight loss, how to avoid it by taking ursodiol, which will be prescribed in the postoperative period. ,Long-term complication of gastric bypass including hair loss, excess skin, multivitamin and mineral deficiencies, protein-calorie malnutrition, weight regain, weight plateauing, psychosocial and marital issues, addiction transfer, etc., were all discussed with the patient.  The patient is at higher risk than usual set of patients secondary to his supermorbid obesity of BMI nearing 70 and also major cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities.  Smoking of course does not help and increase the risk for cardiopulmonary complications and is at increased risk for cardiac risk.  He will be seen by cardiologist, pulmonologist.  He will also undergo long Medifast dieting under our guidance, which is a very low-calorie diet to decrease the size of the liver and also to optimize his cardiopulmonary and metabolic comorbidities.  He will also see a psychologist, nutritionist, and exercise physiologist in preparation for surgery for a multidisciplinary approach for short and long-term success. ,Especially for him in view of his restricted mobility, supermorbid obesity status, and possibility of a pulmonary hypertension secondary to sleep apnea, he has been advised to have retrievable IVC filter and also will go home on Lovenox.  He also needs to start exercising to increase his flexibility and muscle tone before surgery and also to start getting the habit of doing so.  All these were discussed with the patient.  The patient understands.  He wants to go to surgery.  All questions were answered.  I will see him in few weeks before the planned date of surgery.",Bariatrics

Total abdominal hysterectomy.,2.  Bilateral salpingooophorectomy.,3.  Repair of bladder laceration.,4.  Appendectomy.,5.  Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy.,6.  Posterior colpoperineoplasty.,GROSS FINDINGS:  The patient had a history of a rapidly growing mass on the abdomen, extending from the pelvis over the past two to three months.  She had a recent D&C and laparoscopy, and enlarged mass was noted and could not be determined if it was from the ovary or the uterus.  Curettings were negative for malignancy.  The patient did have a large cystocele and rectocele, and a collapsed anterior and posterior vaginal wall.,Upon laparotomy, there was a giant uterine tumor extending from the pelvis up to the above the umbilicus compatible with approximately four to five-month pregnancy.  The ovaries appeared to be within normal limits.  There was marked adherence between the bladder and the giant uterus and mass with edema and inflammation, and during dissection, a laceration inadvertently occurred and it was immediately recognized.  No other pathology noted from the abdominal cavity or adhesions.  The upper right quadrant of the abdomen compatible with a previous gallbladder surgery.  The appendix is in its normal anatomic position.  The ileum was within normal limits with no Meckel's diverticulum seen and no other gross pathology evident.  There was no evidence of metastasis or tumors in the left lobe of the liver.,Upon frozen section, diagnosis of initial and partial is that of a degenerating uterine fibroid rather than a malignancy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room, prepped and draped in the low lithotomy position under general anesthesia.  A midline incision was made around the umbilicus down to the lower abdomen.  With a #10 Bard Parker blade knife, the incision was carried down through the fascia.  The fascia was incised in the midline, muscle fibers were splint in the midline, the peritoneum was grasped with hemostats and with a #10 Bard Parker blade after incision was made with Mayo scissors.  A Balfour retractor was placed into the wound.  This giant uterus was soft and compatible with a possible leiomyosarcoma or degenerating fibroid was handled with care.  The infundibular ligament on the right side was isolated and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture brought to an avascular area, doubly clamped and divided from the ovary and the ligament again re-ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The right round ligament was ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, brought to an avascular space within the broad ligament and divided from the uterus.  The infundibulopelvic ligament on the left side was treated in a similar fashion as well as the round ligament.  An attempt was made to dissect the bladder flap from the anterior surface of the uterus and this was remarkably edematous and difficult to do, and during dissection the bladder was inadvertently entered.  After this was immediately recognized, the bladder flap was wiped away from the anterior surface of the uterus.  The bladder was then repaired with a running locking stitch #0 Vicryl suture incorporating serosal muscularis mucosa and then the second layer of overlapping seromuscular sutures were used to make a two-layer closure of #0 Vicryl suture.  After removing the uterus, the bladder was tested with approximately 400 cc of sterile water and there appeared to be no leak.  Progressing and removing of the uterus was then carried out and the broad ligament was clamped bilaterally with a straight Ochsner forceps and divided from the uterus with Mayo scissors, and the straight Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture thus controlling the uterine blood supply.  The cardinal ligaments containing the cervical blood supply was serially clamped bilaterally with a curved Ochsner forceps, divided from the uterus with #10 Bard Parker blade knife and a curved Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture.  The cervix was again grasped with a Lahey tenaculum and pubovesicocervical ligament was entered and was divided using #10 Bard Parker blade knife and then the vaginal vault and with a double pointed sharp scissors.  A single-toothed tenaculum was placed on the cervix and then the uterus was removed from the vagina using hysterectomy scissors.  The vaginal cuff was then closed using a running #0 Vicryl suture in locking stitch incorporating all layers of the vagina, the cardinal ligaments of the lateral aspect and uterosacral ligaments on the posterior aspect.  The round ligaments were approximated to the vaginal cuff with #0 Vicryl suture and the bladder flap approximated to the round ligaments with #000 Vicryl suture.  The ______ was re-peritonealized with #000 Vicryl suture and then the cecum brought into the incision.  The pelvis was irrigated with approximately 500 cc of water.  The appendix was grasped with Babcock forceps.  The mesoappendix was doubly clamped with curved hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors.  The curved hemostats were placed with #00 Vicryl suture.  The base of the appendix was ligated with #0 plain gut suture, doubly clamped and divided from the distal appendix with #10 Bard Parker blade knife, and the base inverted with a pursestring suture with #00 Vicryl.  No bleeding was noted.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were found to be correct.  All packs and retractors were removed.  The peritoneum muscle fascia was closed in single-layer closure using running looped #1 PDS, but prior to closure, a Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy was carried out by dissecting the space of Retzius identifying the urethra in the vesical junction approximating the periurethral connective tissue to the symphysis pubis with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Following this, the abdominal wall was closed as previously described and the skin was closed using skin staples.  Attention was then turned to the vagina, where the introitus of the vagina was grasped with an Allis forceps at the level of the Bartholin glands.  An incision was made between the mucous and the cutaneous junction and then a midline incision was made at the posterior vaginal mucosa in a tunneling fashion with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flaps were created bilaterally by making an incision in the posterior connective tissue of the vagina and wiping the rectum away from the posterior vaginal mucosa, and flaps were created bilaterally.  In this fashion, the rectocele was reduced and the levator ani muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Excess vaginal mucosa was excised and the vaginal mucosa closed with running #00 Vicryl suture.  The bulbocavernosus and transverse perinei muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #00 Vicryl suture.  The skin was closed with a running #000 plain gut subcuticular stitch.  The vaginal vault was packed with a Betadine-soaked Kling gauze sponge.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was sent to recovery room in stable condition.",Urology

2437,"CATARACT, is the loss of transparency of the lens of the eye.  It often appears like a window that is fogged with steam.,WHAT CAUSES CATARACT FORMATION?,*  Aging, the most common cause.,*  Family history.,*  Steroid use.,*  Injury to the eye.,*  Diabetes.,*  Previous eye surgery.,*  Long-term exposure to sunlight.,HOW DO I KNOW IF I HAVE A CATARACT?,*  The best way for early detection is regular eye examinations by your medical eye doctor. There are many causes of visual loss in addition to the cataract such as problems involving the optic nerve and retina.  If these other problems exist, cataract removal may not result in the return or improvement of vision.  Your eye doctor can tell you how much improvement in vision is likely.,DOES IT TAKE A LONG TIME FOR A CATARACT TO FORM?,Cataract development varies greatly between patients and is affected by the cause of the cataract.  Generally, cataracts progress gradually over many years.  Some people, especially diabetics and younger patients, may find that cataract formation progresses rapidly over a few months making it impossible to know exactly how long it will take for the cataract to develop. ,WHAT IS THE TREATMENT FOR CATARACTS?,The only way to remove a cataract is surgery.  If the symptoms are not restricting your activity, a change of glasses may alleviate the symptoms at this time.  No medications, exercise, optical devices or dietary supplements have been shown to stop the progression or prevent cataracts.,It is important to provide protection from excessive sunlight.  Making sure that the sunglasses you wear screen out ultraviolet (UV) light rays or your regular eyeglasses are coated with a clear, anti-UV coating will help prevent or slow the progression of cataracts.,HOW DO I KNOW IF I NEED SURGERY?,Surgery is considered when your vision is interfering with your daily activities.  It is important to evaluate if you can see to do your job and drive safely.  Can you read and watch TV in comfort? Are you able to cook, do your shopping and yard work or take your medications without difficulty? Depending on how you feel your vision is affecting your daily life, you and your eye doctor will decide together when it is the appropriate time to do surgery.,WHAT IS INVOLVED WITH CATARACT SURGERY?,This surgery is generally performed under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis.  With the assistance of a microscope, the cloudy lens is removed and replaced with a permanent intraocular lens implant.,Right after the surgery you should be able to immediately perform all your normal activities except for the most strenuous ones.  You will need to take eye drops as directed by your eye doctor.  Follow-up visits are necessary to make sure the surgical site is healing without problems.,This procedure is performed on over 1.4 million people each year in the United States alone, 95% without complications.  With this highly successful procedure, 90% of the time vision improves unless a problem also exists with the cornea, retina or optic nerve.  As with any surgery, a good result cannot be guaranteed.",Ophthalmology

4971,"ANGINA, is chest pain due to a lack of oxygen to the heart most often occurring in men age 35 or older and postmenopausal women.  It is usually located right under the breast bone.  Physical and emotional stress, as well as eating heavy meals, can bring it on.  In a healthy person, these stresses are easily handled.  In a person with an underlying heart condition like coronary artery disease, heart valve problem, arrhythmias or high blood pressure, the heart doesn't get enough blood (i.e. not enough oxygen to the heart muscles).  Other causes could be due to a hyperactive thyroid disorder or anemia.  People more likely to have angina may also have diabetes mellitus, be overweight, smoke, have a poor diet with lots of salt and fat, fail to exercise, have a stressful workload or have a family history of coronary artery disease.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,*  Pain in chest described as tightness, heavy pressure, aching or squeezing.,*  The pain sometimes radiates to the jaw, left arm, teeth and/or outer ear.,*  Possibly a left-sided numbness, tingling, or pain in the arm, shoulder, elbow or chest.,*  Occasionally a sudden difficulty in breathing occurs.,*  Pain may be located between the shoulder blades.,TREATMENT:,*  Nitroglycerin relieves the immediate symptoms of angina in seconds.  Carry it with you at all times.,*  Other medications may be prescribed for the underlying heart problems.  It is important to take them as prescribed by your doctor.,*  Surgery may be necessary to open the blocked coronary arteries (balloon angioplasty) or to bypass them.,*  Correct the contributing factors you have control over.  Lose weight, don't smoke, eat a low-salt, low-fat diet and avoid physical and emotional stresses that cause angina.  Such stressors include anger, overworking, going between extremes in hot and cold, sudden physical exertion and high altitudes (pressurized airplanes aren't a risk).  Practice relaxation techniques.,*  Exercise! Discuss first what you are able to do with your doctor and then go do it.,*  Even with treatment, angina may result in a heart attack, congestive heart failure or a fatal abnormal heartbeat.  Treatment decreases the odds that these will occur.,*  Let your doctor know if your angina doesn't go away after 10 minutes, even when you have taken a nitroglycerin tablet.  Call if you have repeated chest pains that awaken you from sleep regardless if the nitroglycerin helps.  If your pain changes or feels different, call your doctor or call 911 if the pain is severe.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

The patient asked me about antibiotics and I did not see a need to do this since he did not appear to have an infection other than viral given his normal temperature, normal pulse, normal respiratory rate, and near normal oxygen.  The patient being on Coumadin I explained to him that unless there was a solid reason to put him on antibiotics, he would be advised not to do so because antibiotics can alter the gut floor causing the INR to increase while on Coumadin which may cause serious bleeding.  The patient understands this.  I then asked him if the cough was annoying him, he said it was.  I offered him a cough syrup, which he agreed to take.  The patient was then discharged with Tussionex Pennkinetic a hydrocodone time-release cough syrup.  I told to check in three days, if the symptoms were not getting better.  The patient appeared to be content with this treatment and was discharged in approximately 30 to 45 minutes later.  His wife calls me very angry that I did not give him antibiotics.

Left reoperative neck dissection levels 1 and the infraclavicular fossa on the left side.  Right levels 2 through 5 neck dissection and superior mediastinal dissection of lymph nodes and pretracheal dissection of lymph nodes in a previously operative field.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient is a 37-year-old gentleman well known to me with a history of medullary thyroid cancer sporadic in nature having undergone surgery in 04/07 with final pathology revealing extrafocal, extrathyroidal extension, and extranodal extension in the soft tissues of his medullary thyroid cancer.  The patient had been followed for a period of time and underwent rapid development of a left and right infraclavicular lymphadenopathy and central neck lymphadenopathy also with imaging studies to suggest superior mediastinal disease.  Fine-needle aspiration of the left and right infraclavicular lymph nodes revealed persistent medullary thyroid cancer.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedures discussed with in detail and the patient elected to proceed with surgery as discussed.  The risks included, but not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, lip, tongue, shoulder, weakness, tongue numbness, droopy eyelid, tumor comes back, need for additional treatment, diaphragm weakness, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, others.  The patient understood all these issues and did wish to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  The patient was intubated with a number 7 nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were protected with Tegaderm.  The patient was rotated to 180 degrees towards the operating surgeon.  The Foley catheter was placed into the bladder with good return of urine.  Attention then was turned to securing the nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube and this was confirmed to be working adequately.  A previous apron incision was incorporated and advanced over onto the right side to the mastoid tip.  The incision then was planned around the old scar to be excised.  A 1% lidocaine with 1 to 100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied.  The incision was made, the apron flap was raised to the level of the mandible and mastoid tip bilaterally all the way down to the clavicle and sternal notch inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to performing the level 1 dissection on the left.  Subsequently the marginal mandibular nerve was identified over the facial notch of the mandible.  The facial artery and vein were individually ligated and marginal mandibular nerve traced superiorly and perifascial lymph nodes freed from the marginal mandibular nerve.  Level 1A lymph nodes of the submental region were dissected off the mylohyoid and digastric.  The submandibular gland was appreciated and retracted laterally.  The mylohyoid muscle appreciated.  The lingual nerve was appreciated and the submandibular ganglion was ligated.  The hypoglossal nerve was appreciated and protected and digastric tunnel was then made posteriorly and the lymph nodes posterior along the marginal mandibular nerve and into the parotid gland were then dissected and incorporated into the specimen for histopathologic analysis.  The marginal mandibular nerve stimulated at the completion of this portion of the procedure.  Attention was then turned to incising the fascia along the clavicle on the left side.  Dissection then ensued along the floor of the neck palpating a very large bulky lymph node before the neck was identified.  The brachial plexus and phrenic nerve were identified.  The internal jugular vein identified and the mass was freed from the floor of the neck with careful dissection and suture ligation of vessels.  Attention was then turned to the central neck.  The strap muscles were appreciated in the midline.  There was a large firm mass measuring approximately 3 cm that appeared to be superior to the strap musculature.  A careful dissection with incorporation of a portion of the sternal hyoid muscle in this area for a margin was then performed.  Attention was then turned to identify the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein on the left side.  This was traced inferiorly, internal jugular vein to the brachiocephalic vein.  Palpation deep to this area into the mediastinum and up against the trachea revealed a 1.5 cm lymph node mass.  Subsequently this was carefully dissected preserving the brachiocephalic vein and also the integrity of the trachea and the carotid artery and these lymph nodes were removed in full and sent for histopathologic analysis.  Attention was then turned to the right neck dissection.  A posterior flap on the right was raised to the anterior border of the trapezius.  The accessory nerve was identified in the posterior triangle and traced superiorly and inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to identifying the submandibular gland.  A digastric tunnel was performed back to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side was incised and the omohyoid muscle was appreciated.  The omohyoid muscle was retracted inferiorly.  Penrose drain was placed around the inferior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  Subsequently the internal jugular vein was identified.  The external jugular vein ligated about 1 cm above the clavicle.  Palpation in this area and the infraclavicular region on the right revealed a firm irregular lymph node complex.  Dissection along the floor of the neck then was performed to allow for mobilization.  The transverse cervical artery and vein were individually ligated to allow full mobilization of this mass.  Tissue between the phrenic nerve and the internal jugular vein was clamped and suture ligated.  The tissue was then brought posteriorly from the trapezius muscle to the internal jugular vein and traced superiorly.  The cervical rootlets were transected after the contribution, so the phrenic nerve all the way superiorly to the skull base.  The hypoglossal nerve was identified and protected as the lymph node packet was dissected over the internal jugular vein.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Valsalva maneuver was given.  No bleeding points identified.  The wound was then prepared for closure.  Two number 10 JPs were placed through the left supraclavicular fossa in the previous drain sites and secured with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was closed  with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for platysma, subsequently a 4-0 running Biosyn for the skin, and Indermil.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated on the operating room table, and sent to the postanesthesia care unit in good condition.",Surgery

746,"NAME OF PROCEDURES,1.  Selective coronary angiography.,2.  Left heart catheterization.,3.  Left ventriculography.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The right groin was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The area of the right coronary artery was anesthetized with 2% lidocaine and a 4-French sheath was placed.  Conscious sedation was obtained using a combination of Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  A left #4, 4-French, Judkins catheter was placed and advanced through the ostium of the left main coronary artery.  Because of difficulty positioning the catheter, the catheter was removed and a 6-French sheath was placed and a 6-French #4 left Judkins catheter was placed.  This was advanced through the ostium of the left main coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.  Following this, the 4-French right Judkins catheter was placed and angiograms of the right coronary were performed.  A pigtail catheter was placed and a left heart catheterization was performed, followed by a left ventriculogram.  The left heart pullback was performed.  The catheter was removed and a small injection of contrast was given to the sheath.  The sheath was removed over a wire and an Angio-Seal was placed.  There were no complications.  Total contrast media was 200 mL of Optiray 350.  Fluoroscopy time 5.3 minutes.  Total x-ray dose is 1783 mGy.,HEMODYNAMICS:  ,Rhythm is sinus throughout the procedure.  LV pressure of 155/22 mmHg, aortic pressure of 160/80 mmHg.  LV pullback demonstrates no gradient.,The right coronary artery is a nondominant vessel and free of disease.  This also gives rise to the conus branch and two RV free wall branches.  The left main has minor plaquing in the inferior aspect measuring no more than 10% to 15%.  This vessel then bifurcates into the LAD and circumflex.  The circumflex is a large caliber vessel and is dominant.  This vessel gives rise to a large first marginal artery, a moderate sized second marginal branch, and additionally gives rise to a large third marginal artery and the PDA.  There was a very eccentric and severe stenosis in the proximal circumflex measuring approximately 90% in severity.  The origin of the first marginal artery has a severe stenosis measuring approximately 90% in severity.  The distal circumflex has a 60% lesion just prior to the origin of the third marginal branch and PDA.,The proximal LAD is ectatic.  The LAD gives rise to a large first diagonal artery that has a 90% lesion in its origin and a subtotal occlusion midway down the diagonal.  Distal to the origin of this diagonal branch, there is another area of ectasia in the LAD, followed by an area of stenosis that in some views is approximately 50% in severity.,The left ventriculogram demonstrates hypokinesis of the distal half of the inferior wall.  The overall ejection fraction is preserved.  There is moderate dilatation of the aortic root.  The calculated ejection fraction is 63%.,IMPRESSION,1.

There was papillary tumor on the left wall right at the bladder neck and one on the right dome near the bladder neck on the right side.  The right ureteral opening was difficult to visualize, the left one was normal.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 78-year-old male with history of gross hematuria and recurrent UTIs.  The patient had hematuria.  Cystoscopy revealed atypical biopsy.  The patient came in again with gross hematuria.  The first biopsy was done about a month ago.  The patient was to come back and have repeat biopsies done, but before that came into the hospital with gross hematuria.  The options of watchful waiting, removal of the clots and biopsies were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT and PE were discussed.  Morbidity and mortality of the procedure were discussed.  Consent was obtained from the daughter-in-law who has the power of attorney in Florida.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient had been off of the Coumadin for about 4 days and INR had been reversed.  The patient has significant amount of clot upon entering the bladder.  There was a tight bladder neck contracture.  The prostate was not enlarged.  Using ACMI 24-French sheath, using Ellick irrigation about 2 cupful of clots were removed.  It took about half an hour to just remove the clots.  After removing the clots, using 24-French cutting loop resectoscope, tumor on the left upper wall near the dome or near the 2 o'clock position was resected.  This was lateral to the left ureteral opening.  The base was coagulated for hemostasis.  Same thing was done at 10 o'clock on the right side where there was some tumor that was visualized.  The back wall and the rest of the bladder appeared normal.  Using 8-French cone-tip catheter, left-sided pyelogram was normal.  The right-sided pyelogram was very difficult to obtain and there was some mucosal irritation from the clots.  The contrast did go up to what appeared to be the right ureteral opening, but the mucosa seemed to be very much irritated and it was very difficult to actually visualize the opening.  A little bit of contrast went out, but the force was not made just to avoid any secondary stricture formation.  The patient did have CT with contrast, which showed that the kidneys were normal.  At this time, a #24 three-way irrigation was started.  The patient was brought to Recovery room in stable condition.",Nephrology
3415,"SUBJECTIVE:,  I am asked to see the patient today with ongoing issues around her diabetic control.  We have been fairly aggressively, downwardly adjusting her insulins, both the Lantus insulin, which we had been giving at night as well as her sliding scale Humalog insulin prior to meals.  Despite frequent decreases in her insulin regimen, she continues to have somewhat low blood glucoses, most notably in the morning when the glucoses have been in the 70s despite decreasing her Lantus insulin from around 84 units down to 60 units, which is a considerable change.  What I cannot explain is why her glucoses have not really climbed at all despite the decrease in insulin.  The staff reports to me that her appetite is good and that she is eating as well as ever.  I talked to Anna today.  She feels a little fatigued.  Otherwise, she is doing well.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,Vitals as in the chart.  The patient is a pleasant and cooperative.  She is in no apparent distress.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Diabetes, still with some problematic low blood glucoses, most notably in the morning.  To address this situation, I am going to hold her Lantus insulin tonight and decrease and then change the administration time to in the morning.  She will get 55 units in the morning.  I am also decreasing once again her Humalog sliding scale insulin prior to meals.  I will review the blood glucoses again next week.,",General Medicine

History as well as signs and symptoms are consistent with acute appendicitis as was his CAT scan.  I evaluated the patient in the emergency room and recommended that he undergo the above-named procedure.  The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable with surgery.,FINDINGS: , Patient was found to have acute appendicitis with an inflamed appendix, which was edematous, but essentially no suppuration.,TECHNIQUE:  ,The patient was identified and then taken into the operating room, where after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion.  An infraumbilical incision was made and carried down by blunt dissection to the level of the fascia, which was grasped with an Allis clamp and two stay sutures of 2-0 Vicryl were placed on either side of the midline.  The fascia was tented and incised and the peritoneum entered by blunt finger dissection.  A Hasson cannula was placed and a pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg pressure was obtained.  Patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position, rotated to his left, whereupon under direct vision, the 12-mm midline as well as 5-mm midclavicular and anterior axillary ports were placed.  The appendix was easily visualized, grasped with a Babcock's.  A window was created in the mesoappendix between the appendix and the cecum and the Endo GIA was introduced and the appendix was amputated from the base of the cecum.  The mesoappendix was divided using the Endo GIA with vascular staples.  The appendix was placed within an Endo bag and delivered from the abdominal cavity.  The intra-abdominal cavity was irrigated.  Hemostasis was assured within the mesentery and at the base of the cecum.  All ports were removed under direct vision and then wounds were irrigated with saline antibiotic solution.  The infraumbilical defect was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl suture.  The remaining wounds were irrigated and then everything was closed subcuticular with 4-0 Vicryl suture and Steri-Strips.  Patient tolerated the procedure well, dressings were applied, and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition.",Surgery
1842,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Foreign body, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Foreign body in the right foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Excision of foreign body, right foot and surrounding tissue.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA and local.,HISTORY:,  This 41-year-old male presents to preoperative holding area after keeping himself n.p.o., since mid night for removal of painful retained foreign body in his right foot.  The patient works in the Electronics/Robotics field and relates that he stepped on a wire at work, which somehow got into his shoe.  The wire entered his foot.  His family physician attempted to remove the wire, but it only became deeper in the foot.  The wound eventually healed, but a scar tissue was formed.  The patient has had constant pain with ambulation intermittently since the incident occurred.  He desires attempted surgical removal of the wire.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position with a safety strap placed across his waist for his protection.,A pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied about the right ankle over copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 12 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to administer an ankle block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the foot where approximately a 5 mm long cicatrix was palpated and visualized.  This was the origin and entry point of the previous puncture wound from the wire.  This cicatrix was found lateral to the plantar aspect of the first metatarsal between the first and second metatarsals in a nonweightbearing area.  Next, the Xi-scan was draped and brought into the operating room.  A #25 gauge needles under fluoroscopy were inserted into the plantar aspect of the foot and three planes to triangulate the wire.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make approximately a 3 cm curvilinear ""S""-shaped incision.  Next, the #15 blade was used to carry the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  The medial and lateral margins of the incision were undermined.  Due to the small nature of the foreign body and the large amount of fat on the plantar aspect of the foot, the wires seemed to serve no benefit other then helping with the incision planning.  Therefore, they were removed.  Once the wound was opened, a hemostat was used to locate the wire very quickly and the wire was clamped.  A second hemostat was used to clamp the wire.  A #15 blade was used to carefully transect the fatty tissue around the tip of the hemostats, which were visualized in the base of the wound.  The wire quickly came into visualization.  It measured approximately 4 mm in length and was approximately 1 mm in diameter.  The wire was green colored and metallic in nature.  It was removed with the hemostat and passed off as a specimen to be sent to Pathology for identification.  The wire was found at the level of deep fascia at the capsular level just plantar to the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament.  Next, copious amounts of sterile gentamicin impregnated saline was instilled in the wound for irrigation and the wound base was thoroughly cleaned and inspected.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to throw two simple interrupted deep sutures to remove the dead space.  Next, #4-0 Ethibond was used to close the skin in a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  The standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released.  There was immediate hyperemic flush to the digits noted.  The patient's anesthesia was reversed.  He tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  The patient was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.,Vital signs were stable and vascular status was intact to the right foot.  He was given OrthoWedge shoe.  Ice was applied behind the knee and his right lower extremity was elevated on to pillows.  He was given standard postoperative instructions consisting of rest, ice and elevation to the right lower extremity.  He is to be non-weightbearing for three weeks, at which time, the wound will be evaluated and sutures will be removed.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on 08/22/2003 and was given emergency contact number to call if problems arise.  He was given a prescription for Tylenol #4, #30 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain as well as Celebrex 200 mg #30 take two p.o. q.d. p.c., with 200 mg 12 hours later as a rescue dose.

4739,"REASON FOR CONSULT: , I was asked to see this patient with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, on hospice with inferior ST-elevation MI.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient from prior strokes has expressive aphasia, is not able to express herself in a clear meaningful fashion.  Her daughter who accompanies her is very attentive whom I had met previously during drainage of a malignant hemorrhagic pericardial effusion last month.  The patient has been feeling well for the last several weeks, per the daughter, but today per the personal aide, became agitated and uncomfortable at about 2:30 p.m.  At about 7 p.m., the patient began vomiting, was noted to be short of breath by her daughter with garbled speech, arms flopping, and irregular head movements.  Her daughter called 911 and her symptoms seemed to improve.  Then, she began vomiting.  When the patient's daughter asked her if she had chest pain, the patient said yes.,She came to the emergency room, an EKG showed inferior ST-elevation MI.  I was called immediately and knowing her history, especially, her hospice status with recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, I felt thrombolytic was contraindicated and she would not be a candidate for aggressive interventional therapy with PCI/CABG.  She was begun after discussion with the oncologist, on heparin drip and has received morphine, nitro, and beta-blocker, and currently states that she is pain free.  Repeat EKG shows normalization of her ST elevation in the inferior leads as well as normalization of prior reciprocal changes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.  In early-to-mid December, she had an admission and was found to have a malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade requiring urgent drainage.  We did repeat an echo several weeks later and that did not show any recurrence of the pericardial effusion.  She is on hospice from the medical history, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, history of multiple CVA.,MEDICATIONS: , Medications as an outpatient:,1.  Amiodarone 200 mg once a day.,2.  Roxanol concentrate 5 mg three hours p.r.n. pain.,ALLERGIES:  ,CODEINE.  NO SHRIMP, SEAFOOD, OR DYE ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative for cardiac disease.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke cigarettes.  She uses alcohol.  No use of illicit drugs.  She is divorced and lives with her daughter.  She is a retired medical librarian from Florida.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Unable to be obtained due to the patient's aphasia.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Height 5 feet 3, weight of 106 pounds, temperature 97.1 degrees, blood pressure ranges from 138/82 to 111/87, pulse 61, respiratory rate 22.  O2 saturation 100%.  On general exam, she is an elderly woman with now marked aphasia, which per her daughter waxes and wanes, was more pronounced and she nods her head up and down when she says the word, no, and conversely, she nods her head side-to-side when she uses the word yes with some discordance in her head gestures with vocalization.  HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has dry mucosal membrane.  She now has a right facial droop, which per her daughter is new.  Neck veins are not distended.  No carotid bruits visible.  Skin:  Warm, well perfused.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No wheezes.  Cardiac exam:  S1, S2, regular rate.  No significant murmurs.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended.  Extremities:  Without edema, on limited exam.  Neurological exam seems to show only the right facial droop.,DIAGNOSTIC/LABORATORY DATA: , EKGs as reviewed above.  Her last ECG shows normalization of prior ST elevation in the inferior leads with Q waves and first-degree AV block, PR interval 280 milliseconds.  Further lab shows sodium 135, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 162, troponin 0.17, INR 1.27, white blood cell count 1.3, hematocrit 31, platelet count of 179.,Chest x-ray, no significant pericardial effusion.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is a 69-year-old woman with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, now admitted with cerebrovascular accident and transient inferior myocardial infarction, which appears to be canalized.  I will discuss this in detail with the patient and her daughter, and clearly, her situation is quite guarded with likely poor prognosis, which they are understanding of.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  I think it is reasonable to continue heparin, but clearly she would be at risk for hemorrhagic pericardial effusion recurrence.,2.  Morphine is appropriate, especially for preload reduction and other comfort measures as appropriate.,3.  Would avoid other blood thinners including Plavix, Integrilin, and certainly, she is not a candidate for a thrombolytic with which the patient and her daughter are in agreement with after a long discussion.,Other management as per the medical service.

He has had problem with urinary retention and bladder stones in the past.  He will need to have transurethral resection of prostate to alleviate the above-mentioned problems.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Formation of urethral strictures.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was identified, after which he was taken into the operating room.  General LMA anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given prophylactic antibiotic in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was then positioned, prepped and draped.  Cystoscopy was then performed by using a #26-French continuous flow resectoscopic sheath and a visual obturator.  The prostatic urethra appeared to be moderately hypertrophied due to the lateral lobes and a large median lobe.  The anterior urethra was normal without strictures or lesions.  The bladder was severely trabeculated with multiple bladder diverticula.  There is a very bladder diverticula located in the right posterior bladder wall just proximal to the trigone.  Using the ***** resection apparatus and a right angle resection loop, the prostate was resected initially at the area of the median lobe.  Once the median lobe has completely resected, the left lateral lobe and then the right lateral lobes were taken down.  Once an adequate channel had been achieved, the prostatic specimen was retrieved from the bladder by using an Ellik evacuator.  A 3-mm bar electrode was then introduced into the prostate to achieve perfect hemostasis.  The sheath was then removed under direct vision and a #24-French Foley catheter was then inserted atraumatically with pinkish irrigation fluid obtained.  The patient tolerated the operation well.",Surgery
4722,"MEDICATIONS: , Plavix, atenolol, Lipitor, and folic acid.,CLINICAL HISTORY:  ,This is a 41-year-old male patient who comes in with chest pain, had had a previous MI in 07/2003 and stents placement in 2003, who comes in for a stress myocardial perfusion scan.,With the patient at rest, 10.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi was injected and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained.,PROCEDURE AND INTERPRETATION:  ,The patient exercised for a total of 12 minutes on the standard Bruce protocol.  The peak workload was 12.8 METS.  The resting heart rate was 57 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 123 beats per minute, which was 69% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response.  The blood pressure response was normal with a resting blood pressure of 130/100 and a peak blood pressure of 158/90.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and leg pain.  EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm.  The peak stress EKG did not reveal any ischemic ST-T wave abnormalities.  There was ventricular bigeminy seen during exercise, but no sustained tachycardia was seen.  At peak, there was no chest pain noted.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and left pain.  At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting myocardial perfusion imaging.,MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:,1.  The overall quality of the scan was good.,2.  There was no diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging.,3.  The left ventricular cavity appeared normal in size.,4.  Gated SPECT images revealed mild septal hypokinesis and mild apical hypokinesis.

2439,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Cataract extraction with lens implantation, right eye.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room.  The patient was identified and the correct operative site was also identified.  A retrobulbar block using 5 ml of 2% lidocaine without epinephrine was done after adequate anesthetic was assured, and the eye was massaged to reduce risk of bleeding.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A lid speculum was applied.,A groove incision at the 12 o'clock position was made with a 5700 blade.  This was beveled anteriorly in a lamellar fashion using the crescent knife.  Then the anterior chamber was entered with a slit knife.  The chamber was deepened with Viscoat.  Then a paracentesis at the 3 o'clock position was created using a super sharp blade.  A cystitome was used to nick the anterior capsule and then the capsulotomy was completed with capsulorrhexis forceps.  Hydrodissection was employed using BSS on a blunt 27-gauge needle.,The phaco tip was then introduced into the eye, and the eye was divided into 4 grooves.  Then a second instrument was used, a Sinskey hook, to crack these grooves, and the individual quadrants were brought into the central zone and phacoemulsified.  I/A proceeded without difficulty using the irrigation/aspiration cannula.  The capsule was felt to be clear and intact.  The capsular bag was then expanded with ProVisc.,The internal corneal wound was increased using the slit knife.  The lens was inspected and found to be free of defects, folded, and easily inserted into the capsular bag, and unfolded.  A corneal light shield was then used as the wound was sutured with a figure-of-eight 10-0 nylon suture.  Then the Viscoat was removed using I/A, and the suture drawn up and tied.,The 0.2 ml of gentamicin was injected subconjunctivally.  Maxitrol ointment was instilled into the conjunctival sac.

476,"SINGLE CHAMBER PACEMAKER IMPLANTATION,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Mobitz type II block with AV dissociation and syncope.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Mobitz type II block, status post single chamber pacemaker implantation, Boston Scientific Altrua 60, serial number 123456.,PROCEDURES:,1.  Left subclavian access under fluoroscopic guidance.,2.  Left subclavian venogram under fluoroscopic evaluation.,3.  Insertion of ventricular lead through left subclavian approach and ventricular lead is Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 123456.,4.  Insertion of single-chamber pacemaker implantation, Altrua, serial number 123456.,5.  Closure of the pocket after formation of pocket for pacemaker.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits.  The patient agreed and signed the consent form.  The patient was brought to the cath lab, draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion, received 1.5 mg of versed and 25 mg of Benadryl for conscious sedation.,Access to the right subclavian was successful after the second attempt.  The first attempt accessed the left subclavian artery.  The needle was removed and manual compression applied for five minutes followed by re-accessing the subclavian vein successfully.  The J-wire was introduced into the left subclavian vein.,The anterior wall chest was anesthetized with lidocaine 2%, 2-inch incision using a #10 blade was used.,The pocket was formed using blunt dissection as he was using the Bovie cautery for hemostasis.  The patient went asystole during the procedure.  The transcutaneous pacer was used.  The patient was oxygenating well.  The patient had several compression applied by the nurse.  However, her own rhythm resolved spontaneously and the percutaneous pacer was kept on standby.,After that, the J-wire was tunneled into the pocket and then used to put the #7-French sheath into the left subclavian vein.  The lead from the Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 12345 was inserted through the left subclavian to the right atrium; however, it was difficult to really enter the right ventricle; and while the lead was in place, the side port of the sheath was used to inject 15 mL of contrast to assess the subclavian and the right atrium.  The findings were showing different anatomy, may be consistent with persistent left superior vena cava, and the angle to the right ventricle was different.  At that point, the lead stylet was reshaped and was able to cross the tricuspid valve in a position consistent with the mid septal place.,At that point, the lead was actively fixated.  The stylet was removed.  The R-wave measured at 40 millivolts.  The impedance was 580 and the threshold was 1.3 volt.  The numbers were accepted and because of the patient's fragility and the different anatomy noticed in the right atrium, concern about putting a second lead with re-access of the subclavian was high.  I decided to proceed with a single-chamber pacemaker as a backup system.,After that, the lead sleeve was used to actively fixate the lead in the anterior chest with two Ethibond sutures in the usual fashion.,The lead was attached to the pacemaker in the header.  The pacemaker was single-chamber pacemaker Altura 60, serial number 123456.  After that, the pacemaker was put in the pocket.  Pocket was irrigated with normal saline and was closed into two layers, deep interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and surface as continuous #4-0 Vicryl continuous.,The pacemaker was programmed as VVI 60, and with history is 10 to 50 beats per minute.  The lead position will be evaluated with chest x-ray.,No significant bleeding noticed.,CONCLUSION:  ,Successful single-chamber pacemaker implantation with left subclavian approach and venogram to assess the subclavian access site and the right atrial or right ventricle with asystole that resolved spontaneously during the procedure.  No significant bleed.",Surgery

We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion.  The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication.  The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut.  He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded.  The tape was placed and his arms were well padded.  He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region.  We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space.  We then marked the disc space.  We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space.  We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates.  We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well.  We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone.  We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space.  We then sized a 23-mm plate.  We inserted the screws nicely above and below.  We tightened down the lock-nuts.  We irrigated the wound.  We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate.  We then assured hemostasis once again.  We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion.  The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this.  We obtained an intraoperative x-ray to confirm the proper level and good position of both plates and screw construct on the lateral x-ray and the patient was transferred to the recovery room, moving all four extremities with stable vital signs.  I was present as a primary surgeon throughout the entire case.",Neurosurgery

A time-out process was followed.  Antibiotics were given.  Then, the patient's right deltopectoral area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated.  The right subclavian vein was percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty.  Then using the Seldinger technique, the catheter part of the port, which was a single-lumen port, was passed through the introducer under x-ray guidance and placed in the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium.,A pocket had been fashioned and a single-lumen drum of the port was connected to the catheter, which had been trimmed and affixed to the pectoralis fascia with couple of sutures of Vicryl.  Then, the fascia was closed using subcuticular suture of Monocryl.  The drum was aspirated and irrigated with heparinized saline and then was put in the pocket and the skin was closed.  A dressing was applied including the needle and the port with the catheter so that the floor could use the catheter right away.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in satisfactory condition.

She was counseled to undergo laparoscopic staging.,FINDINGS:,  During the laparoscopy, the uterus was noted to be upper limits of normal size, with a normal-appearing right fallopian tubes and ovaries.  No ascites was present.  On assessment of the upper abdomen, the stomach, diaphragm, liver, gallbladder, spleen, omentum, and peritoneal surfaces of the bowel, were all unremarkable in appearance.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought into the operating room with an intravenous line in placed, and anesthetic was administered.  She was placed in a low anterior lithotomy position using Allen stirrups.  The vaginal portion of the procedure included placement of a ZUMI uterine manipulator with a Koh colpotomy ring and a vaginal occluder balloon.,The laparoscopic port sites were anesthetized with intradermal injection of 0.25% Marcaine.  There were five ports placed, including a 3-mm left subcostal port, a 10-mm umbilical port, a 10-mm suprapubic port, and 5-mm right and left lower quadrant ports.  The Veress needle was placed through a small incision at the base of the umbilicus, and a pneumoperitoneum was insufflated without difficulty.  The 3-mm port was then placed in the left subcostal position without difficulty, and a 3-mm scope was placed.  There were no adhesions underlying the previous vertical midline scar.  The 10-mm port was placed in the umbilicus, and the laparoscope was inserted.  Remaining ports were placed under direct laparoscopic guidance.  Washings were obtained from the pelvis, and the abdomen was explored with the laparoscope, with findings as noted.,Attention was then turned to lymphadenectomy.  An incision in the retroperitoneum was made over the right common iliac artery, extending up the aorta to the retroperitoneal duodenum.  The lymph node bundle was elevated from the aorta and the anterior vena cava until the retroperitoneal duodenum had been reached.  Pedicles were sealed and divided with bipolar cutting forceps.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.  Boundaries of dissection included the ureters laterally, common ileac arteries at uterine crossover inferiorly, and the retroperitoneal duodenum superiorly with careful preservation of the inferior mesenteric artery.  Right and left pelvic retroperitoneal spaces were then opened by incising lateral and parallel to the infundibulopelvic ligament with the bipolar cutting forceps.  The retroperitoneal space was then opened and the lymph nodes were dissected, with boundaries of dissection being the bifurcation of the common iliac artery superiorly, psoas muscle laterally, inguinal ligament inferiorly, and the anterior division of the hypogastric artery medially.  The posterior boundary was the obturator nerve, which was carefully identified and preserved bilaterally.  The left common iliac lymph node was elevated and removed using the same technique.,Attention was then turned to the laparoscopic hysterectomy.  The right infundibulopelvic ligament was divided using the bipolar cutting forceps.  The mesovarium was skeletonized.  A bladder flap was mobilized by dividing the round ligaments using the bipolar cutting forceps, and the peritoneum on the vesicouterine fold was incised to mobilize the bladder.  Once the Koh colpotomy ring was skeletonized and in position, the uterine arteries were sealed using the bipolar forceps at the level of the colpotomy ring.  The vagina was transected using a monopolar hook (or bipolar spatula), resulting in separation of the uterus and attached tubes and ovaries.  The uterus, tubes, and ovaries were then delivered through the vagina, and the pneumo-occluder balloon was reinserted to maintain pneumoperitoneum.  The vaginal vault was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight stitches of 0-Vicryl using the Endo-Stitch device.  The abdomen was irrigated, and excellent hemostasis was noted.,The insufflation pressure was reduced, and no evidence of bleeding was seen.  The suprapubic port was then removed, and the fascia was closed with a Carter-Thomason device and 0-Vicryl suture.  The remaining ports were removed under direct laparoscopic guidance, and the pneumoperitoneum was released.  The umbilical port was removed using laparoscopic guidance.  The umbilical fascia was closed with an interrupted figure-of-eight stitch using 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with interrupted subcuticular stitches using 4-0 Monocryl suture.  The final sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.

Her daughter who accompanies her is very attentive whom I had met previously during drainage of a malignant hemorrhagic pericardial effusion last month.  The patient has been feeling well for the last several weeks, per the daughter, but today per the personal aide, became agitated and uncomfortable at about 2:30 p.m.  At about 7 p.m., the patient began vomiting, was noted to be short of breath by her daughter with garbled speech, arms flopping, and irregular head movements.  Her daughter called 911 and her symptoms seemed to improve.  Then, she began vomiting.  When the patient's daughter asked her if she had chest pain, the patient said yes.,She came to the emergency room, an EKG showed inferior ST-elevation MI.  I was called immediately and knowing her history, especially, her hospice status with recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, I felt thrombolytic was contraindicated and she would not be a candidate for aggressive interventional therapy with PCI/CABG.  She was begun after discussion with the oncologist, on heparin drip and has received morphine, nitro, and beta-blocker, and currently states that she is pain free.  Repeat EKG shows normalization of her ST elevation in the inferior leads as well as normalization of prior reciprocal changes.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.  In early-to-mid December, she had an admission and was found to have a malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade requiring urgent drainage.  We did repeat an echo several weeks later and that did not show any recurrence of the pericardial effusion.  She is on hospice from the medical history, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, history of multiple CVA.,MEDICATIONS: , Medications as an outpatient:,1.  Amiodarone 200 mg once a day.,2.  Roxanol concentrate 5 mg three hours p.r.n. pain.,ALLERGIES:  ,CODEINE.  NO SHRIMP, SEAFOOD, OR DYE ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative for cardiac disease.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke cigarettes.  She uses alcohol.  No use of illicit drugs.  She is divorced and lives with her daughter.  She is a retired medical librarian from Florida.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Unable to be obtained due to the patient's aphasia.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Height 5 feet 3, weight of 106 pounds, temperature 97.1 degrees, blood pressure ranges from 138/82 to 111/87, pulse 61, respiratory rate 22.  O2 saturation 100%.  On general exam, she is an elderly woman with now marked aphasia, which per her daughter waxes and wanes, was more pronounced and she nods her head up and down when she says the word, no, and conversely, she nods her head side-to-side when she uses the word yes with some discordance in her head gestures with vocalization.  HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has dry mucosal membrane.  She now has a right facial droop, which per her daughter is new.  Neck veins are not distended.  No carotid bruits visible.  Skin:  Warm, well perfused.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No wheezes.  Cardiac exam:  S1, S2, regular rate.  No significant murmurs.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended.  Extremities:  Without edema, on limited exam.  Neurological exam seems to show only the right facial droop.,DIAGNOSTIC/LABORATORY DATA: , EKGs as reviewed above.  Her last ECG shows normalization of prior ST elevation in the inferior leads with Q waves and first-degree AV block, PR interval 280 milliseconds.  Further lab shows sodium 135, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 162, troponin 0.17, INR 1.27, white blood cell count 1.3, hematocrit 31, platelet count of 179.,Chest x-ray, no significant pericardial effusion.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is a 69-year-old woman with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, now admitted with cerebrovascular accident and transient inferior myocardial infarction, which appears to be canalized.  I will discuss this in detail with the patient and her daughter, and clearly, her situation is quite guarded with likely poor prognosis, which they are understanding of.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  I think it is reasonable to continue heparin, but clearly she would be at risk for hemorrhagic pericardial effusion recurrence.,2.  Morphine is appropriate, especially for preload reduction and other comfort measures as appropriate.,3.  Would avoid other blood thinners including Plavix, Integrilin, and certainly, she is not a candidate for a thrombolytic with which the patient and her daughter are in agreement with after a long discussion.,Other management as per the medical service.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X of the hospitalist service who will be admitting the patient.",Consult - History and Phy.
2043,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right wrist pain with an x-ray showing a scapholunate arthritic collapse pattern arthritis with osteophytic spurring of the radial styloid and a volar radial wrist mass suspected of being a volar radial ganglion.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right wrist pain with an x-ray showing a scapholunate arthritic collapse pattern arthritis with osteophytic spurring of the radial styloid and a volar radial wrist mass suspected of being a volar radial ganglion; finding of volar radial wrist mass of bulging inflammatory tenosynovitis from the volar radial wrist joint rather than a true ganglion cyst; synovitis was debrided and removed.,PROCEDURE: , Excision of volar radial wrist mass (inflammatory synovitis) and radial styloidectomy, right wrist.,ANESTHESIA:,  Axillary block plus IV sedation.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Zero.,SPECIMENS,1.  Inflammatory synovitis from the volar radial wrist area.,2.  Inflammatory synovitis from the dorsal wrist area.,DRAINS:,  None.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , Patient brought to the operating room.  After induction of IV sedation a right upper extremity axillary block anesthetic was performed by anesthesia staff.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef preoperatively.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet.  Tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand positioned palm up in a lead hand-holder.  A longitudinal zigzag incision over the volar radial wrist mass was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Careful blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Antebrachial fascia was bluntly dissected and incised to reveal the radial artery.  Radial artery was mobilized preserving its dorsal and palmar branches.  Small transverse concomitant vein branches were divided to facilitate mobilization of the radial artery.  Wrist mass was exposed by blunt dissection.  This appeared to be an inflammatory arthritic mass from the volar radial wrist capsule.  This was debrided down to the wrist capsule with visualization of the joint through a small capsular window.  After complete volar synovectomy the capsular window was closed with 4-0 Mersilene figure-of-eight suture.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 PDS and the skin was closed with a running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Forearm was pronated and C-arm image intensifier was used to confirm localization of the radial styloid for marking of the skin incision.  An oblique incision overlying the radial styloid centered on the second extensor compartment was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to identify and protect the superficial radial nerve.  Blunt dissection was carried out in the extensor retinaculum.  This was incised longitudinally over the second extensor compartment.  EPL tendon was identified, mobilized and released to facilitate retraction and prevent injury.  The interval between the ECRL and the ECRB was developed down to bone.  Dorsal capsulotomy was made and local synovitis was identified.  This was debrided and sent as second pathologic specimen.  Articular surface of the scaphoid was identified and seen to be completely devoid of articular cartilage with hard, eburnated subchondral bone consistent with a SLAC pattern arthritis.  Radial styloid had extensive spurring and was exposed subperiosteally and osteotomized in a dorsal oblique fashion preserving the volar cortex as the attachment point of the deep volar carpal ligament layer.  Dorsally the styloidectomy was beveled smooth and contoured with a rongeur.  Final x-rays documenting the styloidectomy were obtained.  Local synovitis beneath the joint capsule was debrided.  Remnants of the scapholunate interosseous which was completely deteriorated were debrided.  The joint capsule was closed anatomically with 4-0 PDS and extensor retinaculum was closed with 4-0 PDS.  Subcutaneous tissues closed with 4-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Steri-Strips were applied to wound edge closure; 10 cc of 0.5% plain Marcaine was infiltrated into the areas of the surgical incisions and radial styloidectomy for postoperative analgesia.  A bulky gently compressive wrist and forearm bandage incorporating an EBI cooling pad were applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.  Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.,DISCHARGE PRESCRIPTIONS:,1.  Keflex 500 mg tablets, #20, one PO q.6h. x 5 days.,2.

The patient received topical lidocaine by nebulization.  The flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was introduced orally.  The patient had normal teeth, normal tongue, normal jaw, and her vocal cords moved symmetrically and were without lesions.  I proceeded to the right upper lobe where a mucous plug was noted in the subsegmental bronchus of the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.  I proceeded under fluoroscopic guidance to guide the biopsy wire in this area and took four biopsies.  Followup fluoroscopy was negative for pneumothorax.  I wedged the bronchoscope in the subsegmental bronchus and achieved good hemostasis after three minutes.,I then proceeded to inspect the rest of the tracheobronchial tree, which was without lesions.  I performed a bronchial washing after the biopsies in the right upper lobe.  I then performed two transbronchial needle aspirations with a Wang needle biopsy in the precarinal area.  All of these samples were sent for histology and cytology respectively.  Estimated blood loss was approximately 5 cc.  Good hemostasis was achieved.  The patient received a total of 12.5 mg of Demerol and 3 mg of Versed and tolerated the procedure well.  Her ASA score was 2.",Surgery

He has also noted to have cord signal at the C4-C5 level secondary to a very large disc herniation that came behind the body at C5 as well and as well as a large disc herniation at C5-C6.  Risks and benefits of the surgery including bleeding, infection, neurologic deficit, nonunion, progressive spondylosis, and lack of improvement were all discussed.  He understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Preoperative antibiotics were given.  The patient was placed in the supine position with all pressure points noted and well padded.  The patient was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  An incision was made approximately above the level of the cricoid.  Blunt dissection was used to expose the anterior portion of the spine with carotid moved laterally and trachea and esophagus moved medially.  We then placed needle into the disc spaces and was found to be at C5-C6.  Distracting pins were placed in the body of C4 and in to the body of C6.  The disc was then completely removed at C4-C5.  There was very significant compression of the cord.  This was carefully removed to avoid any type of pressure on the cord.  This was very severe and multiple free fragments were noted.  This was taken down to the level of ligamentum.  Both foramen were then also opened.  Other free fragments were also found behind the body of C5, part of the body of C5 was taken down to assure that all of these were removed.  The exact same procedure was done at C5-C6; however, if there were again free fragments noted, there was less not as severe compression at the C4-C5 area.  Again part of the body at C5 was removed to make sure that there was no additional constriction.  Both nerve roots were then widely decompressed.  Machine bone allograft was placed into the C4-C5 as well as C5-C6 and then a Zephyr plate was placed in the body of C4 and to the body of C6 with a metal pin placed into the body at C5.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  Fluoroscopy showed good placement and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  Fascia was closed with 3-0 Vicryl, subcuticular 3-0 Dermabond for skin.

It was explained that some or all of these complications might arise at the time of or months to years after surgery.  The patient had a good understanding of the risks with the proposed, elective eye surgery.  The patient accepted these risks and elected to proceed with cataract surgery.  All questions were answered and informed consent was signed and placed in the chart.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  The pupil was dilated per protocol.  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After intravenous sedation, the retrobulbar block was injected followed by several minutes of digital massage.  No signs of orbital tenseness or retrobulbar hemorrhage were present.,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual ophthalmic sterile fashion.  An eyelid speculum was used to separate the eyelids.  A crescent blade was used to make a clear corneal temporally located incision.  A 1-mm Dual-Bevel blade was used to make a paracentesis site.  The anterior chamber was filled with viscoelastic (Viscoat).  The crescent blade was then used to make an approximate 2-mm long clear corneal tunnel through the temporal incision.  A 2.85-mm keratome blade was then used to penetrate into the anterior chamber through the temporal tunneled incision.  A 25-gauge pre-bent cystotome used to begin a capsulorrhexis.  The capsulorrhexis was completed with the Utrata forceps.  A 27-guage needle was used for hydrodissection and three full and complete fluid waves were noted.  The lens was able to be freely rotated within the capsular bag.  Divide-and-conquer ultrasound was used for phacoemulsification.  After four sculpted grooves were made, a bimanual approach with the phacoemulsification tip and Koch spatula was used to separate and crack each grooved segment.  Each of the four nuclear quadrants was phacoemulsified.  Aspiration was used to remove all remaining cortex.  Viscoelastic was used to re-inflate the capsular bag.  An AMO model SI40NB posterior chamber intraocular lens with power *** diopters and serial number *** was injected into the capsular bag.  The trailing haptic was placed with the Sinskey hook.  The lens was made well centered and stable.  Viscoelastic was aspirated.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to an adequate estimated intraocular pressure.  A Weck-Cel sponge was used to check both incision sites for leaks and none were identified.  The incision sites remained well approximated and dry with a well-formed anterior chamber and eccentric posterior chamber intraocular lens.  The eyelid speculum was removed and the patient was cleaned free of Betadine.  Vigamox and Econopred drops were applied.  A soft eye patch followed by a firm eye shield was taped over the operative eye.  The patient was then taken to the Postanesthesia Recovery Unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Discharge instructions regarding activity restrictions, eye drop use, eye shield/patch wearing, and driving restrictions were discussed.  All questions were answered.  The discharge instructions were also reviewed with the patient by the discharging nurse.  The patient was comfortable and was discharged with followup in 24 hours.  Complications none.",Ophthalmology
2920,"REASON FOR CT SCAN: , The patient is a 79-year-old man with adult hydrocephalus who was found to have large bilateral effusions on a CT scan performed on January 16, 2008.  I changed the shunt setting from 1.5 to 2.0 on February 12, 2008 and his family obtained this repeat CT scan to determine whether his subdural effusions were improving.,CT scan from 03/11/2008 demonstrates frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 2.6 cm.  The 3rd ventricular contour which is flat with a 3rd ventricular span of 10 mm.  There is a single shunt, which enters on the right occipital side and ends in the left lateral ventricle.  He has symmetric bilateral subdurals that are less than 1 cm in breadth each, which is a reduction from the report from January 16, 2008, which states that he had a subdural hygroma, maximum size 1.3 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient's subdural effusions are still noticeable, but they are improving at the setting of 2.0.,PLAN: , I would like to see the patient with a new head CT in about three months, at which time we can decide whether 2.0 is the appropriate setting for him to remain at or whether we can consider changing the shunt setting.",Neurology

Partial rhinectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,INDICATIONS: , This is an 81-year-old gentleman who underwent septorhinoplasty many years ago.  He also has a history of a skin lesion, which was removed from the nasal ala many years ago, the details of which he does not recall.  He has been complaining of tenderness and induration of his nasal tip for approximately two years and has been treated unsuccessfully for folliculitis and cellulitis of the nasal tip.  He was evaluated by Dr. A, who performed the septorhinoplasty, and underwent an intranasal biopsy, which showed histologic evidence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma.  The preoperative examination shows induration of the nasal tip without significant erythema.  There is focal tenderness just cephalad to the alar crease.  There is no lesion either externally or intranasally.,PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  Following induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the left nose was decongested with Afrin.  He was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The left nasal cavity was examined by anterior rhinoscopy.  The septum was midline.  There was slight asymmetry of the nares.  No lesion was seen within the nasal cavity either in the area of the intercartilaginous area, which was biopsied by Dr. A, the septum, the lateral nasal wall, and the floor.  The 0-degree nasal endoscope was then used to examine the nasal cavity more completely.  No lesion was detectable.  A left intercartilaginous incision was made with a #15 blade since this was the area of previous biopsy by Dr. A.  The submucosal tissue was thickened diffusely, but there was no identifiable distinct or circumscribed lesion present.  Random biopsies of the submucosal tissue were taken and submitted to pathology for frozen section.  A diagnosis of diffuse invasive squamous cell carcinoma was rendered.  An alar incision was made with a #15 blade and the full-thickness incision was completed with the electrocautery.  The incision was carried more cephalad through the lower lateral cartilage up to the area of the upper lateral cartilage at the superior margin.  The full unit of the left nasal tip was excised completely and submitted to pathology after tagging and labeling it.  Frozen section examination again revealed diffuse squamous cell carcinoma throughout the soft tissues involving all margins.  Additional soft tissue was then taken from all margins tagging them for the pathologist.  The inferior margins were noted to be clear on the next frozen section report, but there was still disease present in the region of the upper lateral cartilage at its insertion with the nasal bone.  A Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum off the maxillary process and off the inferior aspect of the nasal bone.  Additional soft tissue was taken in these regions along the superior margin.  The frozen section examination revealed persistent disease medially and additional soft tissue was taken and submitted to pathology.  Once all margins had been cleared histologically, additional soft tissue was taken from the entire wound.  A 5-mm chisel was used to take down the inferior aspect of the nasal bone and the medial-most aspect of the maxilla.  This was all submitted to pathology for routine permanent examination.  Xeroform gauze was then fashioned to cover the defect and was sutured along the periphery of the wound with interrupted 6-0 nylon suture to provide a barrier and moisture.  The anesthetic was then discontinued as the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.",ENT - Otolaryngology

She then presented to the Labor and Delivery with symptoms of flu.  The baby was then induced and delivered.  The mother had a history of premature babies in the past.  This baby was doing well, and then, we had a significant increasing oxygen requirement from room air up to 85%.  He is now on 60% FiO2.,PHYSICAL FINDINGS,GENERAL:  He appears to be pink, well perfused, and slightly jaundiced.,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 156, 56 respiratory rate, 92% sat, and 59/28 mmHg blood pressure.,SKIN:  He was pink.,He was on the high-frequency ventilator with good wiggle.,His echocardiogram showed normal structural anatomy.  He has evidence for significant pulmonary hypertension.  A large ductus arteriosus was seen with bidirectional shunt.  A foramen ovale shunt was also noted with bidirectional shunt.  The shunting for both the ductus and the foramen ovale was equal left to right and right to left.,IMPRESSION: , My impression is that baby boy, XYZ, has significant pulmonary hypertension.  The best therapy for this is to continue oxygen.  If clinically worsens, he may require nitric oxide.  Certainly, Indocin should not be used at this time.  He needs to have lower pulmonary artery pressures for that to be considered.,Thank you very much for allowing me to be involved in baby XYZ's care.",Consult - History and Phy.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse right lower quadrant incision was made directly over the point of maximal tenderness.  Sharp dissection utilizing Bovie electrocautery was used to expose the external oblique fascia.  The fascia of the external oblique was incised in the direction of the fibers, and the muscle was spread with a clamp.  The internal oblique fascia was similarly incised and its muscular fibers were similarly spread.  The transversus abdominis muscle, transversalis fascia and peritoneum were incised sharply gaining entrance into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, the peritoneal fluid was noted to be clean.,The cecum was then grasped along the taenia with a moist gauze sponge and was gently mobilized into the wound.  After the appendix was fully visualized, the mesentery was divided between Kelly clamps and ligated with 2-0 Vicryl ties.  The base of the appendix was crushed with a clamp and then the clamp was reapplied proximally on the appendix.  The base was ligated with 2-0 Vicryl tie over the crushed area, and the appendix amputated along the clamp.

We carried our dissection down through the scar tissue to what seemed to be a fascial layer.  We incised through the fascial layer down to some scarred gluteus maximus muscle and down over what was initially felt to be the greater trochanter.  Dissection was carried down through soft tissue and the distal located antibiotic spacer was exposed.  This was used as a landmark to orient remainder of the dissection.  The antibiotic spacer was exposed and followed distally to expose the proximal femur.  Dissection was continued posteriorly and proximally to expose the acetabulum.  A cobra retractor was able to be inserted across the superior aspect of the acetabulum to enhance exposure.  Once improved visualization was obtained, the antibiotic spacer was removed from the femur.  This allowed further improved visualization of the acetabulum.  The acetabulum was filled with soft tissue debris and scar tissue.  This was removed with sharp excision with a knife as well as with a rongeur and a Bovie.  Once soft tissue was removed, the acetabulum was reamed.  Reaming was started with a 46-mm reamer and carried up sequentially to prepare for 50-mm shell.  The 50 mm shell was trialed and had good stability and fit.  Attention was then turned to continue preparation of the femur.  The canal was then debrided with femoral canal curettes.  Some fibrous tissue was removed from the canal.  The length of the femoral stem was then checked with this canal curette in place.  Following x-rays, we prepared to begin reaming the femur.  This femur was reamed over a guide rod using flexible reaming rods.  The canal was reamed up to 13.5 mm distally in preparation for 14 mm stem.  The stem was selected and initially size A body was placed in trial.  The body was too tight proximally to fit.  The proximal canal was then reamed for a size AA body.  A longer stem with an anterior bow was selected and a size AA trial was assembled.  This fit nicely in the canal and had good fit and fill.  Intraoperative radiographs were obtained to determine component position.  Intraoperative radiographs revealed satisfactory length of the component past the distal of fractures in the femur.  The remainder of the trial was then assembled and the hip was relocated and trialed.  Initially, it was found to be unstable posteriorly.  We changed from a 10 degree lip liner to 20 degree lip liner.  Again, the hip was trialed and found to be unstable posteriorly.  This was due to reversion of the femoral component.  As we attempted to seat the prosthesis, the stent continued to attempt to turn in retroversion.  The stem was extracted and retrialed.  Improved stability was obtained and we decided to proceed with the real components.  A 20 degree liner was inserted into the acetabular shell.  The real femoral components were assembled and inserted into the femoral canal.  Again, the hip was trialed.  The components were found to be in relative retroversion.  The real components were then backed down and the neck was placed in the more anteversion and reinserted.  Again, the stem attempted to follow in the relative retroversion.  Along with this time, however, it was improved from previous attempts.  The femoral head trial was placed back on the components and the hip relocated.  It was taken to a range of motion and found to have improved stability compared to previous trialing.  Decision was made to accept the component position.  The real femoral head was selected and implanted.  The hip was then taken again to a range of motion.  It was stable at 90 degrees of flexion with 20 degrees of adduction and 40 degrees of internal rotation.  The patient reached full extension and had no instability anteriorly.,The wound was then irrigated again with pulsatile lavage.  Six liters of pulsatile lavage was used during the procedure.,The wound was then closed in a layered fashion.  A Hemovac drain was placed deep to the fascial layer.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 PDS, and staples in the skin.  An incisional VAC was then placed over the wound as well.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the close of the case.,DISPOSITION:,  The patient will be weightbearing as tolerated with posterior hip precautions.",Surgery

Severe mucosal irregularity with endobronchial narrowing of the right middle and lower lobes.,6.  Left vocal cord irregularity.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Fiberoptic flexible bronchoscopy with lavage, brushings, and endobronchial mucosal biopsies of the right bronchus intermedius/right lower lobe.,ANESTHESIA: , Demerol 50 mg with Versed 3 mg as well as topical cocaine and lidocaine solution.,LOCATION OF PROCEDURE: , Endoscopy suite #4.,After informed consent was obtained and following the review of the procedure including procedure as well as possible risks and complications were explained and consent was previously obtained, the patient was sedated with the above stated medication and the patient was continuously monitored on pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, and EKG monitoring.  Prior to starting the procedure, the patient was noted to have a baseline oxygen saturation of 86% on room air.  Subsequently, she was given a bronchodilator treatment with Atrovent and albuterol and subsequent saturation increased to approximately 90% to 91% on room air.,The patient was placed on a supplemental oxygen as the patient was sedated with above-stated medication.  As this occurred, the bronchoscope was inserted into the right naris with good visualization of the nasopharynx and oropharynx.  The cords were noted to oppose bilaterally on phonation.  There was some slight mucosal irregularity noted on the vocal cord on the left side.  Additional topical lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords, at which point the bronchoscope was introduced into the trachea, which was midline in nature.  The bronchoscope was then advanced to the distal trachea and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this time, the bronchoscope was further advanced through the main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  Bronchoscope was then further advanced into the right upper lobe, which revealed no evidence of any endobronchial lesion.  The mucosa was diffusely friable throughout.  Bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn into the right main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this point, the bronchoscope was then advanced to the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, it was noted that there was severe mucosal irregularities of nodular in appearance significantly narrowing the right lower lobe and right middle lobe opening.  The mucosal area throughout this region was severely friable.  Additional lidocaine was instilled as well as topical epinephrine.  At this time, bronchoscope was maintained in this region and endobronchial biopsies were performed.  At the initial attempt of inserting biopsy forceps, some resistance was noted within the proximal channel at this time making advancement of the biopsy forceps out of the proximal channel impossible.  So the biopsy forceps was withdrawn and the bronchoscope was completely withdrawn and new bronchoscope was then utilized.  At this time, bronchoscope was then reinserted into the right naris and subsequently advanced to the vocal cords into the right bronchus intermedius without difficulty.  At this time, the biopsy forceps were easily passed and visualized in the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, multiple mucosal biopsies were performed with some mild oozing noted.  Several aliquots of normal saline lavage followed.  After completion of multiple biopsies there was good hemostasis.  Cytology flushing was also performed in this region and subsequently several aliquots of additional normal saline lavage was followed.  Bronchoscope was unable to be passed distally to the base of the segment of the right lower lobe or distal to the further visualized endobronchial anatomy of the right middle lobe subsegments.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the distal trachea.,At this time, bronchoscope was then advanced to the left main stem.  Additional lidocaine was instilled.  The bronchoscope was advanced to the left upper and lower lobe subsegments.  There was no endobronchial lesion visualized.  There is mild diffuse erythema and fibromucosa was noted throughout.  No endobronchial lesion was visualized in the left bronchial system.  The bronchoscope was then subsequently further withdrawn to the distal trachea and readvanced into the right bronchial system.  At this time, bronchoscope was readvanced into the right bronchus intermedius and additional aliquots of normal saline lavage until cleared.  There is no gross bleeding evidenced at this time or diffuse mucosal erythema and edema present throughout.  The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room.  During the bronchoscopy, the patient noted ________ have desaturation and required increasing FiO2 with subsequent increased saturation to 93% to 94%.  The patient remained at this level of saturation or greater throughout the remaining of the procedure.,The patient postprocedure relates having some intermittent hemoptysis prior to the procedure as well as moderate exertional dyspnea.  This was confirmed by her daughter and mother who were also present at the bedside postprocedure.  The patient did receive a nebulizer bronchodilator treatment immediately prebronchoscopy and postprocedure as well.  The patient also admitted to continued smoking in spite of all of the above.  The patient was extensively counseled regarding the continued smoking especially with her present symptoms.  She was advised regarding smoking cessation.  The patient was also placed on a prescription of prednisone 2 mg tablets starting at 40 mg a day decreasing every three days to continue to wean off.  The patient was also administered Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV x1 in recovery room.  There was no significant bronchospastic component noted, although because of the severity of the mucosal edema, erythema, and her complaints, short course of steroids will be instituted.  The patient was also advised to refrain from using any aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication because of her hemoptysis.  At this time, the patient was also advised that if hemoptysis were to continue or worsen or develop progressive dyspnea, to either contact myself, , or return to ABCD Emergency Room for evaluation of possible admission.

The patient has had a recurrently infected cyst of his mass at the superior aspect of his incision, which he says gets larger and then it drains internally, causing him to be quite ill.  He presented to my office and I recommended that he undergo exploration of this area and removal.  The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, and alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable to surgery.,FINDINGS:,  The patient was found upon excision of the cyst that it contained a large Prolene suture, which is multiply knotted as it always is; beneath this was a very small incisional hernia, the hernia cavity, which contained omentum; the hernia was easily repaired.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of an LMA anesthetic, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion.  The puncta of the wound lesion was infiltrated with methylene blue and peroxide.  The lesion was excised and the existing scar was excised using an ellipse and using a tenotomy scissors, the cyst was excised down to its base.  In doing so, we identified a large Prolene suture within the wound and followed this cyst down to its base at which time we found that it contained omentum and was in fact overlying a small incisional hernia.  The cyst was removed in its entirety, divided from the omentum using a Metzenbaum and tying with 2-0 silk ties.

The patient presents to Labor and Delivery in active preterm labor and dilated approximately 4 to 6 cm.  The decision for C-section was made.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a supine position with a slight left lateral tilt and she was then prepped and draped in usual fashion for a low transverse incision.  The patient was then given general anesthesia and once this was completed, first knife was used to make a low transverse incision extending down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in a transverse fashion with the use of curved Mayo scissors.  The edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher and both blunt and sharp dissection was then completed both caudally and cephalically.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the center and extended in a vertical fashion.  Peritoneum was entered at a high point and extended in a vertical fashion as well.  The bladder blade was put in place.  The bladder flap was created with the use of Metzenbaum scissors and dissected away caudally.  The second knife was used to make a low transverse incision with care being taken to avoid the presenting part of the fetus.  The first fetus was vertex.  The fluid was clear.  The head was delivered followed by the remaining portion of the body.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut.  The newborn handed off to waiting pediatrician and nursery personnel.  The second fluid was ruptured.  It was the clear fluid as well.  The presenting part was brought down to be vertex.  The head was delivered followed by the rest of the body and the cord was doubly clamped and cut, and newborn handed off to waiting pediatrician in addition of the nursery personnel.  Cord pH blood and cord blood was obtained from both of the cords with careful identification of A and B. Once this was completed, the placenta was delivered and handed off for further inspection by Pathology.  At this time, it was noted at the uterus was adhered to the abdominal wall by approximately of 3 cm x 3 cm thick uterine adhesion and this was needed to be released by sharp dissection.  Then, there were multiple omental adhesions on the surface of the uterus itself.  This needed to be released as well as on the abdominal wall and then the uterus could be externalized.  The lining was wiped clean of any remaining blood and placental fragments and the edges of the uterus were grasped in four quadrants with Kocher and continuous locking stitch of 0 chromic was used to re-approximate the uterine incision, with the second layer used to imbricate the first.  The bladder flap was re-approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and Gelfoam underneath.  The right fallopian tube was grasped with a Babcock, it was doubly tied off with 0 chromic and the knuckle portion was then sharply incised and cauterized.  The same technique was completed on the left side with the knuckle portion cut off and cauterized as well.  The defect on the uterine surface was reinforced with 0 Vicryl in a baseball stitch to create adequate Hemostasis.  Interceed was placed over this area as well.  The abdominal cavity was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the uterus was placed back in its anatomical position.  The gutters were wiped clean of any remaining blood.  The edges of the peritoneum were grasped with hemostats and a continuous locking stitch was used to re-approximate abdominal rectus muscles as well as the peritoneal edges.  The abdominal rectus muscle was irrigated.  The corners of the fascia grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitch of 0 Vicryl started on both corners and overlapped on the center.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  Cautery was used to create adequate hemostasis and 3-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the subcutaneous tissue.  Skin edges were re-approximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Uterus was evacuated of any remaining blood vaginally.

All in all a high-grade terrible airway obstruction with involvement of the carina, left and right main stem bronchus, mid, distal, and proximal trachea.,TECHNIQUE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, he was brought into the operating field.  A rapid sequence induction was done.  He was intubated with a rigid scope.  Jet ventilation technique was carried out using a rigid and flexible scope.  A thorough airway inspection was carried out with findings as described above.,Dr. D was present in the operating room and we conferred on operative strategy and agreed that the best of strategy would be to first dilate the right main bronchus, cauterize it to control bleeding and then piecemeal removed the stent from distal to proximal.  This is the technique that was carried out in a painstaking fashion removing bits of the stent piecemeal with finally getting all of the visible stent out of the airway.  It should be noted that Dr. Donovan and I felt that two of the metallic stents were probably in place but we cannot be sure because of the terrible anatomy and the fact that the stent pieces were coming out twisted metal in fragments.  Nevertheless, all the visible stent was removed, and the airway was much better after with the dilation of balloon and the rigid scope.  We took measurements and decided to place stents in the trachea, left and right main bronchus using a Dumon Y-stent.  It was measured 18 mm in tracheal diameter and 14 mm in bronchial diameter.  The right main stem stent was 2.25 cm in length, the left main stem stent was 3 cm in length and the tracheal portion was 9 cm in length.  After it was placed, excellent placement was achieved with the proximal end of the stent 3 cm below the true vocal cords.

An incision was made in the right groin and the greater saphenous vein at its junction with the femoral vein was dissected out and all branches were ligated and divided.  Then, an incision was made just below the knee where the greater saphenous vein was also found and connection to varices from the calf were seen.  A third incision was made in the distal third of the right thigh in the area where there was a communication with large branch varicosities.  Then, a vein stripper was passed from the right calf up to the groin and the greater saphenous vein, which was divided, was stripped without any difficultly.  Several minutes of compression was used for hemostasis.  Then, the exposed branch varicosities both in the lower third of the thigh and in the calf were dissected out and then many stabs were performed to do stab phlebectomies at the level of the thigh and the level of the calf as much as the position would allow us to do.,Then in the left thigh, a groin incision was made and the greater saphenous vein was dissected out in the same way as was on the other side.  Also, an incision was made in the level of the knee and the saphenous vein was isolated there.  The saphenous vein was stripped and a several minutes of local compression was performed for hemostasis.  Then, a number of stabs to perform phlebectomy were performed at the level of the calf to excise branch varicosities to the extent that the patient's position would allow us.  Then, all incisions were closed in layers with Vicryl and staples.,Then, the patient was placed in the prone position and the stab phlebectomies of the right thigh and calf and left thigh and calf were performed using 10 to 20 stabs in each leg.

Despite antacid therapy, the patient's pain has continued.  Additional findings were concerning with possibility of a biliary etiology.  The patient was explained the risks and benefits of an EGD as well as a Meltzer-Lyon test where upon bile aspiration was performed.  The patient agreed to the procedure and informed consent was obtained.,GROSS FINDINGS: , No evidence of neoplasia, mucosal change, or ulcer on examination.  Aspiration of the bile was done after the administration of 3 mcg of Kinevac.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was placed in the supine position.  After appropriate anesthesia was obtained, an Olympus gastroscope inserted from the oropharynx through the second portion of duodenum.  Prior to this, 3 mcg of IV Kinevac was given to the patient to aid with the stimulation of bile.  At this time, the patient as well complained of epigastric discomfort and nausea.  This pain was similar to her previous pain.,Bile was aspirated with a trap to enable the collection of the fluid.  This fluid was then sent to lab for evaluation for crystals.  Next, photodocumentation obtained and retraction of the gastroscope through the antrum revealed no other evidence of disease, retroflexion revealed no evidence of hiatal hernia or other mass and after straightening the scope and aspiration ________, gastroscope was retracted.  The gastroesophageal junction was noted at 20 cm.  No other evidence of disease was appreciated here.

He contacted myself and stated that Angelica was going to have her wisdom teeth extracted in the setting of a hospital operating room at Hospital and he inquired if we could pair on the procedure and I could do her full mouth dental rehabilitation before the wisdom teeth were removed by him.  I agreed.  I saw her in my office and she was cooperative for full mouth set of radiographs in my office and a clinical examination.  This clinical and radiographic examination revealed no dental caries; however, she was in need of a good dental cleaning.,OPERATIVE PREPARATION:  ,The patient was brought to Hospital Day Surgery accompanied by her mother.  I met with them and discussed the needs of the child, types of restoration to be performed, and the risks and benefits of the treatment as well as the options and alternatives of the treatment.  After all their questions and concerns were addressed, they gave their informed consent to proceed with the treatment.  The patient's history and physical examination was reviewed.  Once she was cleared by Anesthesia, she was taken back to the operating room.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the surgical table in the usual supine position with all extremities protected.  Anesthesia was induced by mask.  The patient was then intubated with a nasal endotracheal tube and the tube was stabilized.  The head was wrapped and the eyes were taped shut for protection.  An Angiocath was previously placed in preop.  The head and neck were draped in sterile towels, and the body was covered with lead apron and sterile sheath.  A moist continuous throat pack was placed beyond tonsillar pillars.  Plastic lip and cheek retractors were then placed.  Preoperative digital intraoral photographs were taken.  No digital radiographs were taken in the operating room, as I stated before I had a full set of digital radiographs taken in my office.  A prophylaxis was then performed using a Prophy cup and fluoridated Prophy paste after scaling and replaning was done.  She presented with moderate calculus on the buccal surfaces of her maxillary, first molars and lower molars.  She did not require any restorative dentistry.,Upon the conclusion of the restorative phase, the oral cavity was aspirated and found to be free of blood, mucus, and other debris.  The original treatment plan was verified with the actual treatment provided.  Postoperative clinical photographs were taken.  The continuous gauze throat pack was removed with continuous suction and visualization.  Topical fluoride was then placed on the teeth.,At the end of the procedure, the child was undraped, extubated, and awakened in the operating room, taken to the recovery room, breathing spontaneously with stable vital signs.,FINDINGS: , This patient presented in her permanent dentition.  Her teeth #1, 16, 17, and 32 were impacted and are going to be removed following my full mouth dental rehabilitation by Dr. Alexander.  Oral hygiene was fair.  There was generalized plaque and calculus throughout.  She did not have any caries, did not require any restorative dentistry.,CONCLUSION:,  Following my dental surgery, the patient continued to intubated and was prepped for oral surgery procedures by Dr. X and his associates.  There were no postop pain requirements.  I did not have any specific requirements for the patient or her mother and that will be handled by Dr. X and their instructions on soft foods, etc., and pain control will be managed by them.",Surgery
1292,"SUBJECTIVE: , The patient is a 60-year-old female, who complained of coughing during meals.  Her outpatient evaluation revealed a mild-to-moderate cognitive linguistic deficit, which was completed approximately 2 months ago.  The patient had a history of hypertension and TIA/stroke.  The patient denied history of heartburn and/or gastroesophageal reflux disorder.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,OBJECTIVE: , Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. ABC.  The patient was seated upright in a video imaging chair throughout this assessment.  To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); puree consistency (teaspoon x2); and solid food consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,ASSESSMENT,ORAL STAGE:,  Premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid.  Decreased tongue base retraction, which contributed to vallecular pooling after the swallow.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , No aspiration was observed during this evaluation.  Penetration was noted with cup sips of thin liquid only.  Trace residual on the valleculae and on tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement are within functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  ,The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.  Radiologist noted reduced peristaltic action of the constricted muscles in the esophagus, which may be contributing to the patient's complaint of globus sensation.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:,  No aspiration was noted during this evaluation.  Penetration with cup sips of thin liquid.  The patient did cough during this evaluation, but that was noted related to aspiration or penetration.,PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: ,Based on this evaluation, the prognosis for swallowing and safety is good.,PLAN: , Based on this evaluation and following recommendations are being made:,1.  The patient to take small bite and small sips to help decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration.,2.  The patient should remain upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after meals to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration as well as to reduce her globus sensation.,3.  The patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation of her esophageal function.,The patient does not need any skilled speech therapy for her swallowing abilities at this time, and she is discharged from my services.",Speech - Language

Additional high-resolution sagittal and/or coronal reconstructed images were obtained through the facial bones and cervical spine for better visualization of the osseous structures.,INTERPRETATIONS:,HEAD:,There is mild generalized atrophy.  Scattered patchy foci of decreased attenuation is seen in the subcortical and periventricular white matter consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.  There are subtle areas of increased attenuation seen within the frontal lobes bilaterally.  Given the patient's clinical presentation, these likely represent small hemorrhagic contusions.  Other differential considerations include cortical calcifications, which are less likely.  The brain parenchyma is otherwise normal in attenuation without evidence of mass, midline shift, hydrocephalus, extra-axial fluid, or acute infarction.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  The bony calvarium and skull base are unremarkable.,FACIAL BONES:,The osseous structures about the face are grossly intact without acute fracture or dislocation.  The orbits and extra-ocular muscles are within normal limits.  There is diffuse mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and right maxillary sinuses.  The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  Diffuse soft tissue swelling is noted about the right orbit and right facial bones without underlying fracture.,CERVICAL SPINE:,There is mild generalized osteopenia.  There are diffuse multilevel degenerative changes identified extending from C4-C7 with disk space narrowing, sclerosis, and marginal osteophyte formation.  The remaining cervical vertebral body heights are maintained without acute fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis.  The central canal is grossly patent.

There were no adnexal masses appreciated.  The vulva and perineum appeared normal.  Laparoscopic findings revealed normal appearing uterus, fallopian tubes bilaterally as well as ovaries bilaterally.  There was a functional cyst on the left ovary.  There was filmy adhesion in the left pelvic sidewall.  There were two clear lesions consistent with endometriosis, one was on the right fallopian tube and the other one was in the cul-de-sac.  The uterosacrals and ovarian fossa as well as vesicouterine peritoneum were free of any endometriosis.  The liver was visualized and appeared normal.  The spleen was also visualized.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 34-year-old gravida 4, para-4-0-0-4 Caucasian female who desires permanent sterilization.  She recently had a spontaneous vaginal delivery in June and her family planning is complete.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and placed under general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A bimanual exam was performed and the above findings were noted.  Prior to beginning the procedure, her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's posterior vagina and the 12 o' clock position of the cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum.  The cervix was dilated so that the uterine elevator could be placed.  Gloves were exchanged and attention was then turned to the anterior abdominal wall where the skin at the umbilicus was everted and using the towel clips, a 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  The Veress needle was then inserted and using sterile saline ______ the pelvic cavity.  The abdomen was then insufflated with appropriate volume and flow of CO2.  The #11 bladed trocar was then placed and intraabdominal placement was confirmed with the laparoscope.  A second skin incision was made approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis and under direct visualization, a 7 mm bladed trocar was placed without difficulty.  Using the Hulka clip applicator, the left fallopian tube was identified, followed out to its fimbriated end and the Hulka clip was then placed snugly against the uterus across the entire diameter of the fallopian tube.  A second Hulka clip was then placed across the entire diameter just proximal to this.  There was good hemostasis at the fallopian tube.  The right fallopian tube was then identified and followed out to its fimbriated end and the Hulka clip was placed. snugly against the uterus across the entire portion of the fallopian tube in a 90 degree angle.  A second Hulka clip was placed just distal to this again across the entire diameter.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  At this point, the abdomen was desufflated and after it was desufflated, the suprapubic port site was visualized and found to be hemostatic.  The laparoscope and remaining trocars were then removed with good visualization of the peritoneum and fascia and the laparoscope was removed.  The umbilical incision was then closed with two interrupted #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The suprapubic incision was then closed with Steri-Strips.  The uterine elevator was removed and the single-toothed tenaculum site was found to be hemostatic.  The patient tolerated that procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  She will follow up postoperatively for followup care.",Surgery

The patient has had increasing depression and has been under stress as a result of dissolution of her second marriage.  She notes starting in January, her husband of five years seemed to be quite withdrawn.  It turned out, he was having an affair with one of her best friends and he subsequently moved in with this woman.  The patient is distressed, as over the five years of their marriage, she has gotten herself into considerable debt supporting him and trying to find a career that would work for him.  They had moved to ABCD where he had recently been employed as a restaurant manager.  She also moved her mother and son out there and is feeling understandably upset that he was being dishonest and deceitful with her.  She has history of seasonal affective disorder, winter depressions, characterized by increased sleep, increased irritability, impatience, and fatigue.  Some suggestion on her part that her father may have had some mild bipolar disorder and including the patient has a cyclical and recurrent mood disorder.  In January, she went on citalopram.  She reports since that time, she has lost 40 pounds of weight, has trouble sleeping at night, thinks perhaps her mood got worse on the citalopram, which is possible, though it is also possible that the progressive nature of getting divorce than financial problems has contributed to her worsening mood.,PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , She was born in XYZ.  She describes the family as being somewhat dysfunctional.  Father was a truckdriver.  She is an only child.  She reports that she had a history of anorexia and bulimia as a teenager.  In her 20s, she served six years in Naval Reserve.  She was previously married for four years.  She described that as an abusive relationship.  She had a history of being in counseling with ABC, but does not think this therapist, who is now by her estimate 80 years old, is still in practice.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,GENERAL:  This is an alert and cooperative woman.,VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.1, pulse 60, respirations 18, blood pressure 95/54, oxygen saturation 95%, and weight is 132.,PSYCHIATRIC:  She makes good eye contact.

Overdose of citalopram and warfarin.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , The patient reports she has been feeling better since discontinuing antidepressants.  I, therefore, recommend she stay off antidepressants at present.  If needed, she can take Prozac, which has been effective for her in the past and she plans to see a psychiatrist for consultation.  She does give a fairly good history of seasonal depression and given that her mood has improved in the past with Prozac, this will be an appropriate agent to try as needed in the future, but given the situational nature of the depression, she primarily appears to need counseling.,Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if there is additional information I can provide.",Psychiatry / Psychology

Suppression was attempted, however, unsuccessful.  She presents today with her thyroid goiter.  A thyroidectomy was indicated at this time secondary to the patient's chronic condition.  Indications, alternatives, risks, consequences, benefits, and details of the procedure including specifically the risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis or paralysis or vocal cord dysfunction and possible trach were discussed with the patient in detail.  She agreed to proceed.  A full informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient presented to ABCD General Hospital on 09/04/2003 with the history was reviewed and physical examinations was evaluated.  The patient was brought by the Department of Anesthesiology, brought back to surgical suite and given IV access and general endotracheal anesthesia.  A 9 cc of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 of epinephrine was infiltrated into the area of pre-demarcated above the suprasternal notch.  Time is allowed for full hemostasis to be achieved.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A #10 blade was then utilized to make an incision in the pre-demarcated and anesthetized area.  Unipolar electrocautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Finger dissection was carried out in the superior and inferior planes.  Platysma was identified and dissected and a subplatysmal plane was created in the superior and inferior, medial and lateral directions using hemostat, Metzenbaum, and blunt dissection.  The strap muscles were identified.  The midline raphe was not easily identifiable at this time.  An incision was made through what appeared to be in the midline raphe and dissection was carried down to the thyroid.  Sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were identified and separated on the patient's right side and then subsequently on the left side.  It was noted at this time that the thyroid lobule on the right side is a bi-lobule.  Kitner blunt dissection was utilized to bluntly dissect the overlying thyroid fascia as well as strap muscles off the thyroid, force in the lateral direction.  This was carried down to the inferior and superior areas.  The superior pole of the right lobule was then identified.  A hemostat was placed in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was placed in this area.  A second Kitner was placed on lateral aspect of the superior pole and the superior pole of the right thyroid was retracted inferiorly.  Careful dissection was then carried out in a very meticulous fashion in the superior lobe and identified the appropriate vessels and cauterized with bipolar or ligated with the suture ligature.  This was carried out until the superior pole was identified.  Careful attention was made to avoid nerve injury in this area.  Dissection was then carried down again bluntly separating the inferior and superior lobes.  The bilobed right thyroid was then retracted medially.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve was then identified and tracked to its insertion.  The overlying vessels of the middle thyroid vein as well as the associated structures were then identified and great attention was made to perform a right careful meticulous dissection to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve off the thyroid.  When it was completed, this lobule was then removed from Berry's ligament.  There was noted to be no isthmus at this time and the entire right lobule was then sent to the Pathology for further evaluation.  Attention was then diverted to the patient's left side.  In a similar fashion, the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were already separated.  Army-Navy as well as femoral retractors were utilized to lateralize the appropriate musculature.  The middle thyroid vein was identified.  Blunt dissection was carried out laterally to superiorly once again.  A hemostat was utilized to make an opening in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was then placed in this area.  Another Kitner was placed on the lateral aspect of the superior lobe of the left thyroid and retracted inferiorly.  Once again, a careful meticulous dissection was utilized to identify the appropriate structures in the superior pole of the left thyroid and suture ligature as well as bipolar cautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Once again, a careful attention was made not to injure the nerve in this area.  The superior pole was then freed appropriately and blunt dissection was carried down to lateral and inferior aspects.  The inferior aspect was then identified.  The inferior thyroid artery and vein were then identified and ligated.  The left thyroid was then medialized and the recurrent laryngeal nerve has been identified.  A careful dissection was then carried out to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the side as close to the thyroid gland as possible.  The thyroid was then removed from the Berry's ligament and it was then sent to Pathology for further evaluation.  Evaluation of the visceral space did not reveal any bleeding at this time.  This was irrigated and pinpoint areas were bipolored as necessary.  Surgicel was then placed bilaterally.  The strap muscles as well as the appropriate fascial attachments were then approximated with a #3-0 Vicryl suture in the midline.  The platysma was identified and approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture and the subdermal plane was approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture.  A running suture consisting of #5-0 Prolene suture was then placed and fast absorbing #6-0 was then placed in a running fashion.  Steri-Strips, Tincoban, bacitracin and a pressure gauze was then placed.  The patient was then admitted for further evaluation and supportive care.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.",Surgery

She was transfused with packed red blood cells.  Her hemolysis seemed to slow down.  She also on presentation had indications of urinary tract infection with urinalysis significant for 2+ leukocytes, positive nitrites, 3+ protein, 3+ blood, 25 to 100 white cells, 10 to 25 bacteria, 10 to 25 epithelial cells on clean catch specimen.  Culture subsequently grew out no organisms; however, the child had been pretreated with amoxicillin about x3 doses prior to presentation to the hospital.  She had a blood culture, which was also negative.  She was empirically started on presentation with the cefotaxime intravenously.  Her white count on presentation was significantly elevated at 20,800, subsequently increased to 24.7 and then decreased to 16.6 while on antibiotics.  After antibiotics were discontinued, she increased over the next 2 days to an elevated white count of 31,000 with significant bandemia, metamyelocytes and myelocytes present.  She also had three episodes of vomiting and thus she is being taken to the procedure room today for a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis that may being inadvertently treated in treating her UTI.,I discussed with The patient's parents prior to the procedure the lumbar puncture and moderate sedation procedures.  The risks, benefits, alternatives, complications including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, respiratory depression.  Questions were answered to their satisfaction.  They would like to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After ""time out"" procedure was obtained, the child was given appropriate monitoring equipment including appropriate vital signs were obtained.  She was then given Versed 1 mg intravenously by myself.  She subsequently became sleepy, the respiratory monitors, end-tidal, cardiopulmonary and pulse oximetry were applied.  She was then given 20 mcg of fentanyl intravenously by myself.  She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Dr. X cleansed the patient's back in a normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  She inserted a 22-gauge x 1.5-inch spinal needle in the patient's L3-L4 interspace that was carefully identified under my direct supervision.  Clear fluid was not obtained initially, needle was withdrawn intact.  The patient was slightly repositioned by the nurse and Dr. X reinserted the needle in the L3-L4 interspace position, the needle was able to obtain clear fluid, approximately 3 mL was obtained.  The stylette was replaced and the needle was withdrawn intact and bandage was applied.  Betadine solution was cleansed from the patient's back.,During the procedure, there were no untoward complications, the end-tidal CO2, pulse oximetry, and other vitals remained stable.  Of note, EMLA cream had also been applied prior procedure, this was removed prior to cleansing of the back.,Fluid will be sent for a routine cell count, Gram stain culture, protein, and glucose.,DISPOSITION: , The child returned to room on the medical floor in satisfactory condition.",Neurosurgery

He was unable to walk and would not stand upright, and had fairly significant discomfort, so the parents checked his panel because of it.  Because of this, they took him to Emergency Department, at which time, he had no swelling noted initially, but very painful.  He had no voiding or stooling problems.  No nausea, vomiting or fever.  Family denies trauma or dysuria.  At that time, he was going to get an ultrasound done, but the mother said that all of sudden the patient stated the pain had resolved.  He has had hot chocolate this morning at 10:30 in the morning and water around 2:30 in the morning.  He has not had any pain since but states that he has had pain in the past, not as long and states there was a twisting sensation.

His left testis was slightly harder than the right, but this was not very significant.,EXTREMITIES:  He had full range of motion in all 4 extremities.,SKIN:  Warm, pink, and dry.,NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.,LABORATORY DATA: , Ultrasound was obtained today showing no blood flow or poor blood flow on the left except for increased blood flow to the epididymis on the study done at about 1330 hours, and second one done around 1630 hours was normal flow, possible increased flow on the left.  This is personally reviewed by me.  The right was normal.  No masses were appreciated.  There was some mild change in echotexture on the left on the initial study, which had apparently resolved on the second, but may be due to the technical aspects of the study.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , The patient has a possibly torsion detorsion versus other acute testicular problem.  If the patient has indeed testicular torsion, there is an increased possibility that it may reoccur again, actually within the first 24 to 36 hours and as such is recommended doing a left scrotal exploration with possible detorsion of left testis, possible orchiectomy if the testis is markedly abnormal or nonviable, which probably is not the case, and bilateral testes fixation if the torsion is found.  I discussed the pre and postsurgical care with the parents.  Procedure itself with potential complications, risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery including that the torsion could occur again, although it is less likely after the surgical fixation procedure.  The parents understand and wished to proceed.  We will schedule this later today emergently.",Urology

The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia of the pectoralis major muscle medially beneath the inferior third of the right clavicle was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine.  An incision transverse, parallel, and inferior to the middle third of the right clavicle was performed.  A subcutaneous pocket on the surface of the pectoralis major muscle was created.  The muscular fascia was also infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine.  With the patient in the Trendelenburg position, utilizing the provided introducer needle, the right subclavian vein was cannulated.  A guidewire was passed without difficulty and the needle was removed.  Fluoroscopy confirmed satisfactory position of the guidewire in the right atrium.  A dilator and sheath was passed over the guidewire.  The guidewire and dilator were removed and a provided catheter was inserted through the sheath and the sheath was carefully withdrawn.  Fluoroscopy again confirmed satisfactory position of the catheter and the catheter under fluoroscopic guidance was retracted into the superior vena cava.  The catheter had been preflushed with dilute heparin solution (100 units/mL).  The port, which had been preflushed with saline, was attached to the catheter at approximately 13 cm level.  The locking cap had been placed on the catheter.  The port was connected to the catheter and the locking cap was secured.  The port was again flushed with dilute heparin solution and placed within the subcutaneous pocket.  Fluoroscopy again confirmed satisfactory position.  A hard copy of the fluoroscopy was obtained.  The catheter and port were secured to the pectoralis fascia in four locations with 2-0 Prolene suture.  Site was irrigated with saline.  Hemostasis was verified.

4862,"REASON FOR CATHETERIZATION:,  ST-elevation myocardial infarction.,PROCEDURES UNDERTAKEN,1.  Left coronary system cineangiography.,2.  Right coronary system cineangiography.,3.  Left ventriculogram.,4.  PCI to the left circumflex with a 3.5 x 12 and a 3.5 x 8 mm Vision bare-metal stents postdilated with a 3.75-mm noncompliant balloon x2.,PROCEDURE: , After all risks and benefits were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the cardiac cath suite.  Right groin was prepped in usual sterile fashion.  Right common femoral artery was cannulated with the modified Seldinger technique.  A 6-French sheath was introduced.  Next, Judkins right catheter was used to engage the right coronary artery and cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, an EBU 3.5 guide was used to engage the left coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in several views and it was noted to have a 99% proximal left circumflex stenosis.  Angiomax bolus and drip were started after checking an ACT, which was 180, and an Universal wire was advanced through the left circumflex beyond the lesion.  Next, a 3.0 x 12 mm balloon was used to pre-dilate the lesion.  Next a 3.5 x 12 mm Vision bare-metal stent was advanced to the area of stenosis and deployed at 12 atmospheres.  There was noted to be a plaque shift proximally at the edge of the stent.  Therefore, a 3.5 x 8 mm Vision bare-metal stent was advanced to cover the proximal margin of the first stent and deployed at 12 atmospheres.  Next, a 3.75 x 13 mm noncompliant balloon was advanced into the margin of the stent and two inflations at 20 atmospheres were done for 20 seconds.  Final images showed excellent results with initial 99% stenosis reduced to 0%.  The patient continues to have residual stenosis in the mid to distal in the OM branch.  At this point, wire was removed.  Final images confirmed initial stent results, no evidence of dissection, perforation, or complications.,Next, an angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricular cavity.  LV pressure was measured.  LV gram was done in both the LAO and RAO projections and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve was done and recorded.  Finally, all guides were removed.  Right femoral artery access site was imaged and Angio-Seal deployed to attain excellent hemostasis.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well without complications.,DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS,1.  Left main:  Left main is a large-caliber vessel bifurcating in LAD and left circumflex with no significant disease.,2.  The LAD:  LAD is a large-caliber vessel, wraps around the apex, gives off multiple septal perforators, three small-to-medium caliber diagonal branches without any significant disease.,3.  Left circumflex:  Left circumflex is a large-caliber vessel, gives off a large distal PDA branch, has a 99% proximal lesion, 50% mid vessel lesion, and a 50% lesion in the OM, which is a distal branch.,4.  Right coronary artery:  Right coronary artery is a moderate-caliber vessel, dominant, bifurcates into PDA and PLV branches, has only mild disease.  Otherwise, no significant stenosis noted.,5.  LV:  The LVEF 50%.  Inferolateral wall hypokinesis.  No significant mitral regurgitation.  No gradient across the aortic valve on pullback.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , ST-elevation myocardial infarction with a 99% stenosis of the proximal portion of the left circumflex treated with a 3.5 x 12 mm Vision bare-metal stent and a 3.5 x 8 mm Vision bare-metal stent.  Excellent results, 0% residual stenosis.  The patient continues to have some residual 50% stenosis in the left circumflex system, some mild disease throughout the other vessels.  Therefore, we will aggressively treat this patient medically with close followup as an outpatient.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

Left salpingo-oophorectomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , Endometrial curettings and left ovarian mass.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 100 cc.,DRAINS:,  None.,FINDINGS: , On bimanual exam, the patient has a slightly enlarged, anteverted, freely mobile uterus with an enlarged left adnexa.  Laparoscopically, the patient has massive pelvic adhesions with completely obliterated posterior cul-de-sac and adnexa.,No adnexal structures were initially able to be visualized until after the lysis of adhesions.  Eventually we found a normal appearing right ovary, severely scarred right and left fallopian tubes, and a enlarged complex cystic left ovary.  There was a normal-appearing appendix and liver, and the vesicouterine junction appeared within normal limits.  There were significant adhesions from the small bowel to the bilateral adnexa in the posterior surface of the uterus.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where a general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  Next, a weighted speculum was placed in the vagina and anterior wall of the vagina was elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was then sounded to 12 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size #20 Hank.  Next a Telfa pad was placed on the weighted speculum and a short curettage was performed obtaining a large amount of endometrial tissue.  Next, the uterine manipulator was placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix.  At this point, the vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed.  Next, attention was turned to the abdomen where an approximately 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to the umbilicus.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp and Veress needle was inserted through this incision.  Small amount of normal saline was injected into Veress needle and seemed to drop freely.  So, the Veress needle was connected to he CO2 gas, which was started at the lower setting.  It was seen to flow freely with a normal resistance so the gas was advanced to the higher setting.  The abdomen was then insufflated to an adequate distention.  Next, the Veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was inserted.  Next, the introducer was removed from the trocar and the laparoscope was inserted through this port and the port was also connected to the CO2 gas.  At this point, the initial operative findings were seen.  Next, a size #5 step trocar was inserted approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis in the midline.  This was done by making a 1 cm incision with the skin knife, introducing a Veress needle with Ethicon sheet, and the Veress needle was then removed and the #5 port was introduced under direct visualization.  A size #5 port was also placed approximately six fingerbreadths to the right of the umbilicus in a similar manner also under direct visualization.  A blunt probe was inserted suprapubically along with a grasper in the right upper quadrant.  These were used to see the above operative findings.  Next, a size #12 mm port was introduced approximately seven fingerbreadths to the left of the umbilicus under direct visualization.  Through this, a Harmonic scalpel was inserted.,The Harmonic scalpel along with the grasper was used to meticulously address the adhesions along the right adnexa in the posterior cul-de-sac.  Care was taken at all times to avoid the bowel and the ureters.  The fallopian tubes appeared massively scarred and completely obliterated from disease.  After the right adnexa had been freed to the point where we could visualize the ovary and the posterior cul-de-sac was clearing off then we could visualize the uterosacral ligaments.  Attention was turned to the left adnexa, which appeared to contain a cystic structure, but it was unclear at the beginning of the procedure what the structure was.  Adhesions were carefully taken down from the bowel to the left fallopian tube and ovary, and sidewall.  The adhesions were then carefully removed from the inferior aspect of the ovary also with the Harmonic scalpel.  At intermittent points throughout the procedure, the suction irrigator was used to irrigate and suck blood and irrigation out of the pelvis to watch for any bleeding.  At this point, the Harmonic scalpel was removed and another laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was inserted and this was used to aspirate approximately 30 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the cystic structure.  Next, the needle was removed and the ligature device was inserted.  This was used to clamp across the fallopian tube initially and then after the fallopian tube was ligated, the uterovarian ligament was clamped and ligated with the ligature device.  Next, the fallopian tube was removed from the ovary with the ligature device in approximately 3 clamping and ligations.  Then, the attention was turned to the inferior aspect of the ovary.  First the infundibulopelvic ligament was identified, clamped with a ligature device, and ligated.  Next, the ovary was bluntly dissected from the ovarian fossa with attention to the left ureter.  Next, the ligature device was used to clamp and ligate the broad ligament immediately inferior to the ovary across.  Then the ovary was completely bluntly dissected out of the ovarian fossa and completely separated from the pelvis.  This was grasped with a clamp.  The ligature device was removed from the #12 and a EndoCatch bag was inserted to the size #12 port.  The left ovary was placed in this EndoCatch bag, which was then removed along with the whole port from the left upper quadrant.  Next, the pelvis was copiously irrigated and suctioned of all blood and extra fluid.  At this point, the remaining two size #5 ports were removed under direct visualization.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was desufflated.  Next, an introducer was replaced on a #11 port.  The #11 port was removed.  Next, the fascia in the left upper quadrant port was identified and grasped with Ochsner clamps, tented up, and closed with a single interrupted suture of #0 Vicryl on a UR-6 needle.  Next, all skin incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  The incisions were cleaned, injected with 0.25% Marcaine, and then adjusted with Steri-Strips and bandage appropriately.,The patient was taken from the operating room in stable condition and should be observed overnight in the hospital.",Obstetrics / Gynecology

The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis and non-healing ulceration to the left hallux of almost 10 years' duration.  He has failed outpatient antibiotic therapy and conservative methods.  At this time, he desires to attempt surgical correction.  The patient is not interested in a hallux amputation at this time; however, he is consenting to removal of infected bone.  He was counseled preoperatively about the strong probability of the hallux being a ""floppy tail"" after the surgery and accepts the fact.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient's wound was debrided with a #15 blade and down to good healthy tissue preoperatively.  The wound was on the planar medial, distal and dorsal medial.  The wound's bases were fibrous.  They did not break the bone at this point.  They were each approximately 0.5 cm in diameter.  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with safety straps placed across his waist for his protection.,Due to the patient's history of diabetes and marked calcifications on x-ray, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was not applied.  Next, a total of 3 cc of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was used to infiltrate the left hallux and perform a digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  It was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the left hallux after the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make a linear incision approximately 3.5 cm in length along the dorsal aspect of the hallux from the base to just proximal to the eponychium.  Next, the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissue.  A heavy amount of bleeding was encountered.  Therefore, a Penrose drain was applied at the tourniquet, which failed.  Next, an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the distal toes and forefoot and was left in the forefoot to achieve hemostasis.  Any small veins crossing throughout the subcutaneous layer were ligated via electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral margins of the incision were under marked with a sharp dissection down to the level of the long extension tendon.  The long extensor tendon was thickened and overall exhibited signs of hypertrophy.  The transverse incision through the long extensor tendon was made with a #15 blade.  Immediately upon entering the joint, yellow discolored fluid was drained from the interphalangeal joint.  Next, the extensor tendon was peeled dorsally and distally off the bone.  Immediately the head of the proximal phalanx was found to be lytic, disease, friable, crumbly, and there were free fragments of the medial aspect of the bone, the head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was removed with a sharp dissection.  Next, after adequate exposure was obtained and the collateral ligaments were released off the head of proximal phalanx, a sagittal saw was used to resect the approximately one-half of the proximal phalanx.  This was passed off as the infected bone specimen for microbiology and pathology.  Next, the base of the distal phalanx was exposed with sharp dissection and a rongeur was used to remove soft crumbly diseased medial and plantar aspect at the base of distal phalanx.  Next, there was diseased soft tissue envelope around the bone, which was also resected to good healthy tissue margins.  The pulse lavage was used to flush the wound with 1000 cc of gentamicin-impregnated saline.  Next, cleaned instruments were used to take a proximal section of proximal phalanx to label a clean margin.  This bone was found to be hard and healthy appearing.  The wound after irrigation was free of all debris and infected tissue.  Therefore anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology.  Next, OsteoSet beads, tobramycin-impregnated, were placed.  Six beads were placed in the wound.  Next, the extensor tendon was re-approximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress technique.,The Esmarch bandage was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of 4 x 4s, Betadine-soaked #0-1 silk, Kerlix, Kling, and a loosely applied Ace wrap.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  He was transported via a cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  His vitals signs were stable and vascular status was intact.  He was given a medium postop shoe that was well-formed and fitting.  He is to elevate his foot, but not apply ice.

The patient returned to Ohio and his friend drove him all the way from Kentucky to Northwest Ohio overnight.  The patient showed up in the emergency department where a CT scan was asked to be performed.  This was performed and reviewed.  The patient, however, had significant amount of soft tissue swelling and therefore he was asked to follow up in 2 days.  At this time, he still had significant swelling, but because of the amount of swelling that he had particularly with the long car ride for many hours with his leg dependent, it was felt to be best to wait.,Indeed after 7 days, the patient started to develop fracture blisters on the posterior medial aspect of his ankle with large blisters measuring approximately 2 to 3 inches.  The patient was x-rayed in the office.  He had lost some of his reduction.  Therefore, he was re-reduced at approximately 7 days and then each time the patient had examination of tissues, he was re-reduced just to keep the pressure off the skin.,An x-ray showed the distal fibular fracture starting at the mortise region laterally.  It appeared as an abduction type injury with minimal rotation.  This was comminuted, fragmented, and impacted.,The medial malleolus fracture was an avulsion type.  The syndesmosis appeared to be intact.  This appeared as an AO type B fracture.  However, this was not a rotational injury.,There is a posterior malleolar fragment attached to the distal fibular fragment, which appeared to be avulsed as well, but comminuted.  CT scan revealed a more serious fracture with an anterior as well as posterior plafond fracture of an anterior fragment, which was undisplaced in the posterior medial corner.  A posterior Tillaux fragment appeared to be separate.  However, in this area, there was significant comminution in the mid portion of the ankle joint.,There were many fragments and defects in this region.,The medial mortise however appeared to be intact with regards to the tibial plafond even though there was an anterior undisplaced fragment.,We discussed delayed open reduction internal fixation with the patient.  He understood the risk of surgery including infection, decreased range of motion, stiffness, neurovascular injury, weakness, and numbness.  We discussed seriously the risk of osteoarthritis because of the comminution in the intraarticular surface shown on the CT scan.  We discussed deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, skin slough, skin necrosis, infection, and need for second surgery.  We discussed shortening, decreased strength, limited use, disability of operative extremity, malunion, nonunion, compartment syndrome, stiffness of the operative extremity, numbness, and weakness.  Examination of the patient revealed that he had slightly decreased sensation on the dorsum of his foot.,The patient was able to flex and extend his toes, had good capillary refill, good dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulse.,The patient's tissues were edematous and we has waited approximately 10 days before performing the surgery when the skin could be wrinkled anteriorly.  We discussed his incision, the medial incision as well as lateral incision and the lateral incision would be more posterolateral to maintain a bridge of at least 6 to 8 cm between the 2 incisions.  We did discuss the skin slough as well as skin necrosis, particularly medially where the most skin pressure was because of displacement laterally.  He understood the posterolateral comminution of the tibial plafond, which would be reduced by aligning up the cortex posteriorly.,We discussed the posterolateral approach with reduction of the fibula.  We discussed that likely the distal fibula would not be removed completely to assess the articular surface as this would likely comminute the fibula, even more fragmentation would occur, and would not be able to obtain an anatomic reduction.  He understood this distal fibular fracture was comminuted and there were missing fragments of bone because they were impacted into intramedullary cancellous space.  With this, the patient understood that the hardware may necessitate removal as well in the future.  We discussed hardware irritation.  We also discussed risk of osteoarthritis, which was nearly 100% particularly because of comminution of this area posteriorly.  With these risks discussed and listed on the consent, the patient wanted the procedure.,OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was brought to operating theater and given successful general anesthetic.  His right leg was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Before prep and drape was performed, a close reduction was tried to be obtained to see whether there was any obstruction to reduction.  It was felt that at one point the posterior tibialis tendon may be intraarticular.,The reduction appeared to line up.  However, there was significant gap of approximately 1.5 to 2 cm between the avulsed medial malleolus fragment and distal tibia.,A lateral incision was made over the fracture site approximately 8 cm long and was taken to subcutaneous tissue.  The superficial peroneal nerve was seen and this was avoided.  The incision was placed posterolateral to fibula.,This was to ensure good flap of tissue between the 2 incisions medial and laterally.  The fracture was seen.  The fracture was elevated and medialized and de-rotated.  The anterior portion of the distal fibula was significantly comminuted with defect.  The posterior aspect was still intact.  However, there were multiple fracture lines demonstrating a crush-type injury.  This was reduced manually.  At this point, dissection was performed bluntly behind the peroneal tendons in between this and flexor hallucis longus tendon.  No sharp dissection was performed.  The posterior malleolar fragment was palpated with the distal fibula reduced.  The posterior malleolar fragment appeared to be reduced as well.,X-ray views confirmed this.,An incision was made, standard incision, curvilinear, medially distal to the medial corner of the mortise and curving anterior and posteriorly around the tip of the medial malleolus.  This was taken only through subcutaneous tissue.  The saphenous vein was found, dissected out.  Its branches were cauterized.  Penrose drain was placed around this.,Dissection was undertaken.  The periosteal tissue was seen and was invaginated into the joint.,This was recovered and flipped back on both sides.  Next, the towel clip was used.  Ends were freshened up using irrigation.  The joint surface appeared to be congruent anteriorly and posteriorly medially.,Anatomic reduction was performed in the medial malleolus using 2 mm K-wires and exchanging these for a 35 mm and a 40 mm, anterior and posterior respectively, partially threaded cancellous screws.  Anatomic reduction was gained.  X-rays were taken showing excellent anatomic reduction.  Next, attention was drawn towards the fibula.  Standard 6-hole one-third tubular plate was applied to this.  Again, this was more of a transverse impacted fracture.  Therefore, interfragmentary screw on an angle could not be used.,The posterior cortex was used to assess anatomic reduction.  Screws were placed.  It was used as a spring plate pushing the distal fibular fragment medially.,Screw holes were filled.  They were double-checked.  Screws had excellent purchase and were tightened up.  At this point, lateral views were taken as well as palpation of posterior lateral fragment was performed in the plafond.  This appeared to show anatomic reduction and did not appear to be a step on the articular surface or the posterior cortex of the distal tibia.,The screw was then placed from anterior medial to posterior lateral into this comminuted fragment.,A 2 mm K-wire was used.  Finger was placed on this fragment and the pin was advanced even before the finger.  X-ray views could show the posterior cortex and location of the pin.  This was then exchanged for a 55 mm partially threaded cancellous screw after tapping was performed.  This was double checked to ensure good positioning and this was so.  On the lateral view, we could see this was not in the joint.  AP views and mortise views showed this was not in the joint.  One could palpate this as well.  The screw was placed slightly proximal to distal in the anteroposterior plane.  At the distal tip of it, it was just in the subchondral bone but not in the joint.  There was slight to excellent purchase of this posterior lateral fragment.  Wounds were copiously irrigated followed by closing using 2-0 Vicryl in inverted fashion followed by staples to skin.  Adaptic, 4 x 4s, abdominal pad was placed on wound, held in place with Kerlix followed by an extensor bandage.  Posterior splint was placed on the patient.  The patient's leg was placed in neutral position.  Significant amount of cast padding were used and large bulky trauma ABD type dressings.  The heel was padded and leg was padded with approximately 2 inches of padding.  Tourniquet was deflated.  The patient had good capillary refill, good pulses, and the patient returned to recovery room in stable condition with no complications.  Physician assistant assisted during the case with retracting as well as holding the medial malleolar fragment and fragments in position while placement screws were applied.  Positioning of the leg was accomplished by the physician assistant.  As well, physician assistant assisted in transport of patient to and from the recovery room, assisted in cautery as well as dissection and retraction of tissue.  The patient is expected to do well overall.  He does have an area of comminution shown on the CT scan.  However, by x-rays, it appears that there is anatomic reduction gained at this posterolateral fragment.  Nonetheless, this area was crushed and the patient will have degenerative changes in the future caused by this crushing area.",Orthopedic

With each stage, a thin layer of tumor-laden tissue was excised with a narrow margin of normal appearing skin, using the Mohs fresh tissue technique.  A map was prepared to correspond to the area of skin from which it was excised.  The tissue was prepared for the cryostat and sectioned.  Each section was coded, cut and stained for microscopic examination.  The entire base and margins of the excised piece of tissue were examined by the surgeon.  Areas noted to be positive on the previous stage (if applicable) were removed with the Mohs technique and processed for analysis.,No tumor was identified after the final stage of microscopically controlled surgery.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complication.

The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mm/Hg.  Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray.  A transverse incision was made in the wrist, between FCR and FCU, one fingerbreadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal-based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A proximal forearm fasciotomy was performed under direct vision.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.  Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the hook of hamate.  The endoscopic instrument was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, the transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.,The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the endoscopic instrument was withdrawn, dividing the transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division o the transverse carpal ligament, the instrument was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified, and complete release was confirmed.,The wound was then closed with running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied, and sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-Strips.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the Recovery Room in satisfactory condition, having tolerated the procedure well.,DE QUERVAIN'S RELEASE: , With the patient under adequate regional anesthesia applied by surgeon using 1% plain Xylocaine, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated to 290 mm/Hg.  A transverse incision was then made over the radial aspect of the wrist overlying the first dorsal tunnel.  Using blunt dissection, the radial sensory nerve branches were dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  The first dorsal tunnel was then identified.  The first dorsal tunnel was incised along the dorsal ulnar border, completely freeing the stenosing tenosynovitis (de Quervain's release).  EPB and APL tendons were inspected and found to be completely free.  The radial sensory nerve was inspected and found to be without damage.,The skin was closed with a running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch and Steri-Strips were applied and, over the Steri-Strips, a sterile dressing, and, over the sterile dressing, a volar splint with the hand in safe position.

A lid speculum was applied to the right eye, and a stab incision into the anterior chamber was done close to the limbus at about the 1 o'clock position with a Superblade, and Xylocaine 1% preservative free 0.25 mL was injected into the anterior chamber, which was then followed by Healon to deepen the anterior chamber. Using a keratome, another stab incision was done close to the limbus at about the 9 o'clock position and with the Utrata forceps, anterior capsulorrhexis was performed, and the torn anterior capsule was totally removed. Hydrodissection and hydrodelineation were performed with the tuberculin syringe filled with BSS. The tip of the phaco unit was introduced into the anterior chamber, and anterior sculpting of the nucleus was performed until about more than two-thirds of the nucleus was removed. Using the phaco tip and the Drysdale hook, the nucleus was broken up into 4 pieces and then phacoemulsified.,The phaco tip was then exchanged for the aspiration/irrigation tip, and cortical materials were aspirated. Posterior capsule was polished with a curette polisher, and Healon was injected into the capsular bag. Using the Monarch intraocular lens inserter, the posterior chamber intraocular lens model SN60WF power +19.50 was placed into the inserter after applying some Healon, and the tip of the inserter was gently introduced through the cornea tunnel wound, into the capsular bag and then the intraocular lens was then inserted inferior haptic first into the back and the superior haptic was placed into the bag with the same instrument. Intraocular lens was then rotated about half a turn with a collar button hook. Healon was removed with the aspiration/irrigation tip, and balanced salt solution was injected through the side port to deepen the anterior chamber. It was found that there was no leakage of fluid through the cornea tunnel wound. For this reason, no suture was applied. Vigamox, Econopred and Nevanac eye drops were instilled and the eye was covered with a perforated shield. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.",Surgery

2373,"DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  Local anesthesia was obtained with a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% bupivacaine given as a peribulbar block.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.,A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Calipers were set at 3.5 mm and a mark was made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.,A 5-0 nylon suture was passed through partial-thickness sclera on either side of this mark.  The MVR blade was used to make a sclerotomy between the pre-placed sutures.  An 8-0 nylon suture was then pre-placed for later sclerotomy closure.  The infusion cannula was inspected and found to be in good working order.  The infusion cannula was placed in the vitreous cavity and secured with the pre-placed sutures.  The tip of the infusion cannula was directly visualized and found to be free of any overlying tissue and the infusion was turned on.,Additional sclerotomies were made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the supranasal and supratemporal quadrants.  The light pipe and vitrectomy handpieces were then placed in the vitreous cavity and a vitrectomy was performed.  There was moderately severe vitreous hemorrhage, which was removed.  Once a view of the posterior pole could be obtained, there were some diabetic membranes emanating along the arcades.  These were dissected with curved scissors and judicious use of the vitrectomy cutter.  There was some bleeding from the inferotemporal frond.  This was managed by raising the intraocular pressure and using intraocular cautery.  The surgical view became cloudy and the corneal epithelium was removed with a beaver blade.  This improved the view.  There is an area suspicious for retinal break near where the severe traction was inferotemporally.  The Endo laser was used to treat in a panretinal scatter fashion to areas that had not received previous treatment.  The indirect ophthalmoscope was used to examine the retinal peripheral for 360 degrees and no tears, holes or dialyses were seen.  There was some residual hemorrhagic vitreous skirt seen.  The soft-tip cannula was then used to perform an air-fluid exchange.  Additional laser was placed around the suspicious area inferotemporally.  The sclerotomies were then closed with 8-0 nylon suture in an X-fashion, the infusion cannula was removed and it sclerotomy closed with the pre-existing 8-0 nylon suture.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut.  A subconjunctival injection of Ancef and Decadron were given and a drop of atropine was instilled over the eye.  The lid speculum was removed.  Maxitrol ointment was instilled over the eye and the eye was patched.  The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable condition.",Ophthalmology

83,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.,TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Mini-laparotomy radical retropubic prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection with Cavermap.,ANESTHESIA: , General by intubation.,Informed consent was obtained for the procedure.  The patient understands the treatment options and wishes to proceed.  He accepts the risks to include bleeding requiring transfusion, infection, sepsis, incontinence, impotence, bladder neck constricture, heart attack, stroke, pulmonary emboli, phlebitis, injury to the bladder, rectum, or ureter, etcetera.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the Operating Room and placed in the supine position, prepped with Betadine solution and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 20- French Foley catheter was inserted into the penis and into the bladder and placed to dependent drainage.  The table was then placed in minimal flexed position.  A midline skin incision was then made from the umbilicus to the symphysis pubis.  It was carried down to the anterior rectus fascia into the pelvis proper.  Both obturator fossae were exposed.  Standard bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections were carried out.  The left side was approached first by myself.  The limits of my dissection were from the external iliac vein laterally to the obturator nerve medially, and from the bifurcation of the common iliac vein proximally to Cooper's ligament distally.  Meticulous lymphostasis and hemostasis was obtained using hemoclips and 2-0 silk ligatures.  The obturator nerve was visualized throughout and was not injured.  The right side was carried out by my assistant under my direct and constant supervision.  Again, the obturator nerve was visualized throughout and it was not injured.  Both packets were sent to Pathology where no evidence of carcinoma was found.,My attention was then directed to the prostate itself.  The  endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  Using gentle dissection with a Kitner, I swept the levator muscles off the prostate and exposed the apical portion of the prostate.  A back bleeding control suture of 0 Vicryl was placed at the mid-prostate level.  A sternal wire was then placed behind the dorsal vein complex which was sharply transected.  The proximal and distal portions of this complex were then oversewn with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, my attention was then turned to the neurovascular bundles.,The urethra was then sharply transected and six sutures of 2-0 Monocryl placed at the 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 o'clock positions.  The prostate was then lifted retrograde in the field and was swept from the anterior surface of the rectum and the posterior layer of Denonvilliers' fascia was incised distally, swept off the rectum and incorporated with the prostate specimen.  The lateral pedicles over the seminal vesicles were then mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles themselves were then mobilized and hemostasis obtained using hemoclips.  Ampullae of the vas were mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  The bladder neck was then developed using careful blunt and sharp dissection.  The prostate was then transected at the level of the bladder neck and sent for permanent specimen.  The bladder neck was reevaluated and the ureteral orifices were found to be placed well back from the edge.  The bladder neck was reconstructed in standard fashion.  It was closed using a running 2-0 Vicryl.  The mucosa was everted over the edge of the bladder neck using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture.  At the end of this portion of the case, the new bladder neck had a stoma-like appearance and would accommodate easily my small finger.  The field was then re-evaluated for hemostasis which was further obtained using hemoclips, Bovie apparatus and 3-0 chromic ligatures.  When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, the aforementioned Monocryl sutures were then placed at the corresponding positions in the bladder neck.  A new 20-French Foley catheter was brought in through the urethra into the bladder.  A safety suture of 0 Prolene was brought through the end of this and out through a separate stab wound in the bladder and through the left lateral quadrant.  The table was taken out of flexion and the bladder was then brought into approximation to the urethra and the Monocryl sutures were ligated.  The bladder was then copiously irrigated with sterile water and the anastomosis was found to be watertight.  The pelvis was also copiously irrigated with 2 liters of sterile water.  A 10-French Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the pelvis and brought out through the right lower quadrant and sutured in place with a 2-0 silk ligature.,The wound was then closed in layers.  The muscle was closed with a running 0 chromic, the fascia with a running 1-0 Vicryl, the subcutaneous tissue with 3-0 plain, and the skin with a running 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular.  Steri-Strips were applied and a sterile dressing.,The patient was taken to the Recovery Room in good condition.  There were no complications.  Sponge and instrument counts were reported correct at the end of the case.",Urology

She was diagnosed with displaced left subcapital hip fracture, now was asked to consult.  With this diagnosis, she was indicated the above-noted procedure.  This procedure as well as alternatives to this procedure was discussed at length with the patient and her son, who has the power of attorney, and they understood them well.,Risks and benefits were also discussed.  Risks include bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerves, risk of further surgery, chronic pain, restricted range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of malunion, risk of nonunion, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for altered activities and altered gait, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  She understood these well and consented, and the son signed the consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The patient was then placed in fracture boots and manipulated under fluoroscopic control until we could obtain near anatomic alignment.  External positions were felt to be present.  At this point, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A guidewire was then placed percutaneously into the tip of the greater trochanter and a small incision was made overlying the guidewire.  An overlying drill was inserted to the proper depths.  A Synthes 11 x 130 degrees trochanteric fixation that was chosen was placed into the intramedullary canal to the proper depth.  Proper rotation was obtained and the guide for the helical blade was inserted.  A small incision was made for this as well.  A guidewire was inserted and felt to be in proper position, in the posterior aspect of the femoral head, lateral, and the center position on AP.  This placed the proper depths and lengths better.  The outer cortex was enlarged and an 85-mm helical blade was attached to the proper depths and proper fixation was done.  Appropriate size screw was then tightened down.  At this point, a distal guide was then placed and drilled across both the cortices.  Length was better.  Appropriate size screw was then inserted.  Proper size and fit of the distal screw was also noted.  At this point, on fluoroscopic control, it was confirming in AP and lateral direction.  We did a near anatomical alignment to the fracture site and all hardware was properly fixed.  Proper size and fit was noted.  Excellent bony approximation was noted.  At this point, both wounds were thoroughly irrigated, hemostasis confirmed, and closure was then begun.,The fascial layers were then reapproximated using #1 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight manner, the subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated with staples.  The area was then infiltrated with a mixture of a 0.25% Marcaine with Epinephrine and 1% plain lidocaine.  Sterile dressing was then applied.  No complication was encountered throughout the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",Orthopedic

He is not participating in regular exercises now because he states since starting flecainide, he has gotten sluggish.  He is employed as an attorney and while he states that overall his mental stress is better, he has noted more recent mental stress this past weekend when he was taking his daughter back to college.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He denies any history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi.  There are some questions especially as his wife has told me that he may have obstructive sleep apnea and not had a formal sleep study.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , Blood pressure 156/93, pulse is 100, respiratory rate 18.  On general exam, he is a pleasant overweight gentleman, in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  He has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins are not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  Affect appropriate.  He is quite oriented and pleasant.  No significant kyphoscoliosis on recumbent back exam.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No wheezes.  No egophony.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2.  Regular rate, controlled.  No significant murmurs, rubs or gallops.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft, nondistended, appears benign.  Extremities without significant edema.  Pulses grossly intact.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA:,  Initial ECG shows atrial flutter.,IMPRESSION: , Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so.  I have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of.  After in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was I primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as I did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of CVA, although we cannot really make that null.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis.  I invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient received a total of 7 mg of Versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the Medical Center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions.  The patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure.  After the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using ""lollipop posterior patch"" with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy.  There was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead EKG.,IMPRESSION: , Cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on Coumadin and his INR is 3.22.  We are going to watch him and discharge him from the Medical Center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, Coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed.  I had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, Dr. X, at Electrophysiology Unit at General Hospital and I will be planning to place a call for Dr. X myself.  Again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and I suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms.,I had previously discussed the case with Dr. Y who is the patient's general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient's bedside regarding our findings.",Consult - History and Phy.

The patient had oligohydramnios and also when placed on the monitor had nonreassuring fetal heart rate with late deceleration.  Due to the IUGR as well a decision for a C-section was made.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a seated position with standard spinal form of anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department.  The patient was then repositioned, prepped and draped in a slight left lateral tilt.  Once this was completed first knife was used to make a low transverse skin incision approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis.  This was extended down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in transverse fashion.  Edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher and both blunt and sharp dissection both caudally and cephalic was completed consistent with the Pfannenstiel technique.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the center, extended in vertical fashion and the peritoneum was entered at a high point and extended in vertical fashion.  Bladder blade was put in place and a bladder flap was created with the use of Metzenbaum and pickups and then bluntly dissected via cautery and reincorporated in the bladder blade.  Second knife was used to make a low transverse uterine incision with care being taken to avoid the presenting part of fetus.  Presenting part was vertex, the head was delivered, followed by the remaining portion of the body.  The mouth and nose were suctioned through bulb syringe and the cord was doubly clamped and cut and then the newborn handed off to waiting nursing personnel.  Cord pH blood and cord blood was obtained.  The placenta was delivered manually and the uterus was externalized and the lining was cleaned off any remaining placental fragments and blood and the incisional edges were reapproximated with 0-chromic and a continuous locking stitch with a second layer used to imbricate the first.  The bladder flap was re-peritonized with Gelfoam underneath and abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the uterus was placed back in its anatomical position.  The gutters were wiped clean of any remaining blood and fluid and the edges of the perineum grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitches of 2-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the abdominal rectus muscle as well as the perineum.  This area was then irrigated.  Cautery was used for adequate hemostasis, corners of the fascia grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitch of 1-Vicryl was started at both corners and overlapped in the center.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Skin edges reapproximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The uterus was evacuated of any remaining clots vaginally.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.  Instrument count, needle count, and sponge counts were all correct.",Surgery
1890,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 4-month-old who presented today with supraventricular tachycardia and persistent cyanosis.  The patient is a product of a term pregnancy that was uncomplicated and no perinatal issues are raised.  Parents; however, did note the patient to be quite dusky since the time of her birth; however, were reassured by the pediatrician that this was normal.  The patient demonstrates good interval weight gain and only today presented to an outside hospital with significant duskiness, some irritability, and rapid heart rate.  Parents do state that she does appear to breathe rapidly, tires somewhat with the feeding with increased respiratory effort and diaphoresis.  The patient is exclusively breast fed and feeding approximately 2 hours.  Upon arrival at Children's Hospital, the patient was found to be in a narrow complex tachycardia with the rate in excess of 258 beats per minute with a successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm with adenosine.  The electrocardiogram following the cardioversion had demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a right atrial enlargement, northwest axis, and poor R-wave progression, possible right ventricular hypertrophy.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Family history is remarkable for an older sibling found to have a small ventricular septal defect that is spontaneously closed.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A complete review of systems including neurologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary are otherwise negative.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  Physical examination that showed a sedated, acyanotic infant who is in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate of 170, respiratory rate of 65, saturation, it is nasal cannula oxygen of 74% with a prostaglandin infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/minute.,HEENT:  Normocephalic with no bruit detected.  She had symmetric shallow breath sounds clear to auscultation.  She had full symmetrical pulses.,HEART:  There is normoactive precordium without a thrill.  There is normal S1, single loud S2, and a 2/6 continuous shunt type of murmur could be appreciated at the left upper sternal border.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.  Liver edge is palpated at 3 cm below the costal margin and no masses or bruits detected.,X-RAYS:,  Review of the chest x-ray demonstrated a normal situs, normal heart size, and adequate pulmonary vascular markings.  There is a prominent thymus.  An echocardiogram demonstrated significant cyanotic congenital heart disease consisting of normal situs, a left superior vena cava draining into the left atrium, a criss-cross heart with atrioventricular discordance of the right atrium draining through the mitral valve into the left-sided morphologic left ventricle.  The left atrium drained through the tricuspid valve into a right-sided morphologic right ventricle.  There is a large inlet ventricular septal defect as pulmonary atresia.  The aorta was malopposed arising from the right ventricle in the anterior position with the left aortic arch.  There was a small vertical ductus as a sole source of pulmonary artery blood flow.  The central pulmonary arteries appeared confluent although small measuring 3 mm in the diameter.  Biventricular function is well maintained.,FINAL IMPRESSION: , The patient has significant cyanotic congenital heart disease physiologically with a single ventricle physiology and ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow and the incidental supraventricular tachycardia now in the sinus rhythm with adequate ventricular function.  The saturations are now also adequate on prostaglandin E1.,RECOMMENDATION: , My recommendation is that the patient be continued on prostaglandin E1.  The patient's case was presented to the cardiothoracic surgical consultant, Dr. X.  The patient will require further echocardiographic study in the morning to further delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy and confirm the central confluence.  A consideration will be made for diagnostic cardiac catheterization to fully delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy prior to surgical intervention.  The patient will require some form of systemic to pulmonary shunt, modified pelvic shunt or central shunt as a durable source of pulmonary blood flow.  Further surgical repair was continued on the size and location of the ventricular septal defect over the course of the time for consideration of possible Rastelli procedure.  The current recommendation is for proceeding with a central shunt and followed then by bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt with then consideration for a septation when the patient is 1 to 2 years of age.  These findings and recommendations were reviewed with the parents via a Spanish interpreter.",Pediatrics - Neonatal

2361,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Cervical spondylosis at C3-C4 with cervical radiculopathy and spinal cord compression.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Cervical spondylosis at C3-C4 with cervical radiculopathy and spinal cord compression.,OPERATION PERFORMED,1.  Anterior cervical discectomy of C3-C4.,2.  Removal of herniated disc and osteophytes.,3.  Bilateral C4 nerve root decompression.,4.  Harvesting of bone for autologous vertebral bodies for creation of arthrodesis.,5.  Grafting of fibular allograft bone for creation of arthrodesis.,6.  Creation of arthrodesis via an anterior technique with fibular allograft bone and autologous bone from the vertebral bodies.,7.  Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation using the operating microscope and microdissection technique.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This 62-year-old man has progressive and intractable right C4 radiculopathy with neck and shoulder pain.  Conservative therapy has failed to improve the problem.  Imaging studies showed severe spondylosis of C3-C4 with neuroforaminal narrowing and spinal cord compression.,A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the nature of the procedure including all risks and alternatives.  He clearly understood it and had no further questions and requested that I proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated using a fiberoptic technique.  The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion doses.  The neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made on a skin crease on the left side of the neck.  Dissection was carried down through the platysmal musculature and the anterior spine was exposed.  The medial borders of the longus colli muscles were dissected free from their attachments to the spine.  A needle was placed and it was believed to be at the C3-C4 interspace and an x-ray properly localized this space.  Castoff self-retaining pins were placed into the body of the C3 and C4.  Self-retaining retractors were placed in the wound keeping the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles.,The annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed.  Quite a bit of overhanging osteophytes were identified and removed.  As I worked back to the posterior lips of the vertebral body, the operating microscope was utilized.,There was severe overgrowth of spondylitic spurs.  A high-speed diamond bur was used to slowly drill these spurs away.  I reached the posterior longitudinal ligament and opened it and exposed the underlying dura.,Slowly and carefully I worked out towards the C3-C4 foramen.  The dura was extremely thin and I could see through it in several areas.  I removed the bony compression in the foramen and identified soft tissue and veins overlying the root.  All of these were not stripped away for fear of tearing this very tissue-paper-thin dura.  However, radical decompression was achieved removing all the bony compression in the foramen, out to the pedicle, and into the foramen.  An 8-mm of the root was exposed although I left the veins over the root intact.,The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar procedure was performed.,Once the decompression was achieved, a high-speed cortisone bur was used to decorticate the body from the greater posterior shelf to prevent backward graft migration.  Bone thus from the drilling was preserved for use for the arthrodesis.,Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  As I had drilled quite a bit into the bodies, I selected a large 12-mm graft and distracted the space maximally.  Under distraction the graft was placed and fit well.  An x-ray showed good graft placement.,Attention was turned to spinal instrumentation.  A Synthes Short Stature plate was used with four 3-mm screws.  Holes were drilled with all four screws were placed with pretty good purchase.  Next, the locking screws were then applied.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of graft, plate, and screws.  The upper screws were near the upper endplate of C3.  The C3 vertebral body that remained was narrow after drilling off the spurs.  Rather than replace these screws and risk that the next holes would be too near the present holes I decided to leave these screws intact because their position is still satisfactory as they are below the disc endplate.,Attention was turned to closure.  A Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab wound incision in the skin.  The wound was then carefully closed in layers.  Sterile dressings were applied along with a rigid Philadelphia collar.  The operation was then terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisted of bone and soft tissue as well as C3-C4 disc material.",Orthopedic
4958,"ASH SPLIT VENOUS PORT,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position and monitored anesthesia care provided by the anesthetist.  The right anterior chest and supraclavicular fossa area, neck, and left side of chest were prepped with Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated in the supraclavicular area and anterior chest along the planned course of the catheter.  The patient was placed into Trendelenburg position.,The right internal jugular vein was accessed by a supraclavicular 19-gauge, thin-walled needle as demonstrated by easy withdrawal of venous blood on the first pass of the needle.  Under fluoroscopic control, a J-wire was advanced into the right atrium.  The needle was removed and the skin puncture site enlarged to about 8 mm with the scalpel.  A second incision was made 5 cm inferior to the right midclavicular line, through which an Ash split catheter was advanced, using the tunneling rod, in a gently curving pass to exit the skin of the neck incision.  The tunneling needle was removed and the catheter split up to the marker as indicated in the recommended use of the catheter.,Sequential dilators were advanced over the J-wire under fluoroscopic control to dilate the subcutaneous tunnel followed by advancement of a dilator and sheath into the right superior vena cava under fluoroscopic control.  The dilator and wire were removed, leaving the sheath in position, through which a double-lumen catheter was advanced into the central venous system.  The sheath was peeled away, leaving the catheter into position.  Each port of the catheter was flushed with dilute heparinized saline.,The patient was returned to the flat position.  The catheter was secured to the skin of the anterior chest using 2-0 Ethilon suture placed through the suture ""wings."",The neck incision was closed with 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular closure and pressure dressing applied.

The right lower extremity was protectively padded.  The left leg was propped with multiple blankets.  The hip was then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A posterior incision was made on the posterolateral aspect of the left hip down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery.  Gluteus fascia was incised in line with a skin incision and the muscle was split posteriorly.  The external rotators were identified after removal of the trochanteric bursa.  Hemostat was utilized to separate the external rotators from the underlying capsule, they were then transected off from their attachment at the posterior intertrochanteric line.  They were then reflected distally.  The capsule was then opened in a T-fashion utilizing the cutting cautery.  Fraction hematoma exuded from the hip joint.  The cork screw was then impacted into the femoral head and it was removed from the acetabulum.  Bone fragments were removed from the neck and acetabulum.  The acetabulum was then inspected and noted to be free from debris.  The proximal femur was then delivered into the wound with the hip internally rotated.,A mortise chisel was then utilized to take the cancellous bone from the proximal femur.  The T-handle broach was then passed down the canal.  The canal was then sequentially broached up to a medium broach.  The calcar was then plained with the hand plainer.  The trial components were positioned into place.  The medium component fit fairly well with the medium 28 mm femoral head.  Once the trial reduction was performed, the hip was taken through range of motion.  There was physiologic crystalling with longitudinal traction.  There was no tendency towards dislocation with flexion of the hip past 90 degrees.  The trial implants were then removed.  The acetabulum was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The medium fenestrated femoral stem was prepared by placing a large segment of bone from the femoral head into the fenestration making it a little larger than the width of the implant to provide a press fit.  The implant was then impacted into place.  The 28 mm femoral head was impacted on the mortise stapler of the femoral stem followed by placement of the 50 mm bipolar cup.  The acetabulum was once again inspected, was free of debris.  The hip was reduced.  It was taken through full range of motion.  There was no tendency for dislocation.  The wound was copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution.  The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Ethibond suture.  External rotators were then reapproximated to the posterior intertrochanteric line utilizing #1 Ethibond in a modified Kessler type stitch.  The wound was once again copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Gluteus fascia was approximated with interrupted #1 Ethibond.  Subcutaneous layers were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and skin approximated with staples.  A bulky dressing was applied to the wound.  The patient was then transferred to the hospital bed, an abductor pillow was positioned into place.  Circulatory status was intact to the extremity at completion of the case.",Orthopedic
3307,"SUBJECTIVE:,  The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.  She is on no hormonal therapy.,PREVENTATIVE HISTORY:,  She is not exercising.  She does not do self breast examinations.  She has recently had her mammogram and it was unremarkable.

Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.

This is secondary to a motor vehicle accident and it was translated appropriately 1 cm.  Risks and benefits have been conferred with the patient as well as the family, they wish to proceed.  The patient was taken to the operating room for a C1-C3 posterior cervical fusion, instrumentation, open reduction and internal fixation.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room #5.  The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated and under general anesthesia without any difficulties.  Spinal cord monitoring was induced.  No changes were seen from the beginning to the end of the case.,Mayfield tongues were placed appropriately.  This was placed in line with the pinna of the ear as well as a cm above the tip of the earlobes.  The patient was subsequently rolled onto the fluoroscopic OSI table in the usual prone position with chest rolls.  The patient's Mayfield tongue was fixated in the usual standard fashion.  The patient was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Midline incision was extended from the base of the skull down to the C4 spinous process.  Full thickness skin fascia developed.  The fascia was incised at midline and the posterior elements at C1, C2, C3, as well as the inferior aspect of the occiput was exposed.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed the level to be C2.,Translaminar screws were placed at C2 bilaterally.  Trajectory was completed with a hand drill and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of pedicles and once this was done, two 3.5 mm translaminar screws were placed bilaterally at C2.  Good placement was seen both in the AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy.  Facet screws were then placed at C3.  Using standard technique of Magerl, starting in the inferomedial quadrant 14 mm trajectories in the 25-degree caudad-cephalad direction as well as 25 degrees in the medial lateral direction was made.  This was subsequently sounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there is no elevation of the trajectory.  A 14 x 3.5 mm screws were then placed appropriately.  Lateral masteries at C1 endplate were placed appropriately.  The medial and lateral borders were demarcated with a Penfield.  The great occipital nerve was retracted out the way.  Starting point was made with a high-speed power bur and midline and lateral mass bilaterally.  Using a 20-degree caudad-cephalad trajectory as well as 10-degree lateral-to-medial direction, the trajectory was completed in 8 mm increments, this was subsequently sounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall of the trajectory.  Once this was done, 24 x 3.5 mm smooth Schanz screws were placed appropriately.  Precontoured titanium rods were then placed between the screws at the C1, C2, C3 and casts were placed appropriately.  Once this was done, all end caps were appropriately torqued.  This completed the open reduction and internal fixation of the C2 fracture, which showed perfect alignment.  It must be noted that the reduction was partially performed on the table using lateral fluoroscopy prior to the instrumentation, almost reducing the posterior vertebral margin of the odontoid fracture with the base of the C2 access.  Once the screws were torqued bilaterally, good alignment was seen both in the AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy, this completed instrumentation as well as open reduction and internal fixation of C2.  The cervical fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements of C1, C2, and C3.  Once this was done, the morselized allograft 30 mL of cortical cancellous bone chips with 10 mL of demineralized bone matrix was placed over the decorticated elements.  The fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl suture figure-of-8.  Superficial drain was placed appropriately.  Good alignment of the instrumentation as well as of the fracture was seen both in the AP and lateral planes.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed using a #2-0 Vicryl suture.  The dermal edges were approximated using staples.  The wound was then dressed sterilely using Bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4x4s, and tape, and the drain was connected appropriately.  The patient was subsequently released with a Mayfield contraption and rolled on to the stretcher in the usual supine position.  Mayfield tongues were subsequently released.  No significant bleeding was appreciated.  The patient was subsequently extubated uneventfully and taken back to the recovery room in satisfactory and stable condition.  No complications arose.",Orthopedic

This is an enhancing lesion suspicious for renal cell carcinoma versus oncocytoma.  I discussed a variety of options with her, and she opted to proceed with a laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy.  All questions were answered, and she wished to proceed with surgery as planned.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After acquisition of appropriate written and informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  Note that, sequential compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and were activated per induction of anesthesia.  After institution of adequate general anesthetic via the endotracheal route, she was placed into the right anterior flank position with the right side elevated in a roll and the right arm across her chest.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and she was securely taped to the table to prevent shifting during the procedure.  Her abdomen was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion after placing a 16-French Foley catheter per urethra to gravity drainage.  The abdomen was insufflated in the right outer quadrant.  Note that, the patient had had previous surgery which complicated accesses somewhat and that she had a previous hysterectomy.  The abdomen was insufflated into the right lateral abdomen with Veress needle to 50 mm of pressure without incident.  We then placed a 10/12 Visiport trocar approximately 7 cm lateral to the umbilicus.  Once this had entered into the peritoneal cavity without incident, the remaining trocars were all placed.  Under direct laparoscopic visualization, we placed three additional trocars; an 11-mm screw-type trocar in the umbilicus, a 6-mm screw-type trocar in the upper midline approximately 7 cm above the umbilicus, and 10/12 trocar in the lower midline about 7 cm below the umbilicus within and over the old hysterectomy scar.  There were some adhesions of omentum to the underside of that scar, and these were taken down sharply using laparoscopic scissors.,We began nephrectomy procedure by reflecting the right colon, by incising the white line of Toldt.  This exposed the retroperitoneum on the right side.  The duodenum was identified and reflected medially in a Kocher maneuver using sharp dissection only.  We then identified the ureter and gonadal vein in the retroperitoneum.  The gonadal vein was left down along the vena cava, and the plane underneath the ureter was elevated and this plane was carried up towards the renal hilum.  Sequential packets of tissue were taken using primarily the LigaSure Atlas device.  Once we got to the renal hilum, it became apparent that this patient had two sets of renal arteries and veins.  We proceeded then and skeletonized the structures into four individual packets.  We then proceeded to perform the upper pole dissection and developing the plane above the kidney and between the kidney and adrenal gland.  The adrenal was spared during this procedure.  There was no contiguous connection between the renal mass and a right adrenal gland.  This plane of dissection was taken down primarily using the LigaSure device.  We then sequentially took the four vessels going to the kidney initially taking two renal arteries with the endo GI stapler and then to renal veins again with endo GI stapler sequential flaring.  Once this was completed, the kidney was free except for its attachment to the ureter and lateral attachments.  The lateral attachments of the kidney were taken down using the LigaSure Atlas device, and then the ureter was doubly clipped and transected.  The kidney was then freed within the retroperitoneum.  A 50-mm EndoCatch bag was introduced through the lower most trocar site, and the kidney was placed into this bag for subsequent extraction.  We extended the lower most trocar site approximately 6 cm to facilitate extraction.  The kidney was removed and passed off the table as a specimen for pathology.  This was bivalved by pathology, and we reviewed the specimen.",Surgery

The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone.  There was some pus that came out.  The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time.  The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin.  The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE.  The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole.,The stent was intact.  The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers.  The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated.  Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment.  The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed.  Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time.  We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated.  So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road.,Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point.,DETAILS OF THE OR: , Consent had been obtained from the patient.  Risks, benefits, and options were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed.  The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given some IV pain meds.  The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop.  Cystoscopy was performed using graspers.  The stent was removed without difficulty.  Plan was for repeat cultures and continuation of the IV antibiotics.",Urology

Upon examination in the office, the patient was found to have a left inguinal hernia consistent with tear, which was scheduled as an outpatient surgery.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a left indirect inguinal hernia.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought to the operating suite.  After spinal anesthesia and sedation given, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  In the area of the left inguinal region just superior to the left inguinal ligament tract, the skin was anesthetized with 0.25% Marcaine.  Next, a skin incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel.  Using Bovie electrocautery, dissection was carried down to Scarpa's fascia until the external oblique was noted.  Along the side of the external oblique in the direction of the external ring, incision was made on both sides of the external oblique and then grasped with a hemostat.  Next, the hernia and hernia sac was circumferentially grasped and elevated along with the round ligament.  Attention was next made to ligating the hernia sac at its base for removal.  The hernia sac was opened prior grasping with hemostats.  It was a sliding indirect hernia.  The bowel contents were returned to abdomen using a #0 Vicryl stick tie pursestring suture at its base.  The hernia sac was ligated and then cut above with the Metzenbaum scissors returning it to the abdomen.  This was then sutured at the apex of the repair down to the conjoint tendon.  Next, attention was made to completely removing the round ligament hernia sac which was again ligated at its base with an #0 Vicryl suture and removed as specimen.  Attention was next made to reapproximate it at floor with a modified ______ repair.  Using a #2-0 Ethibond suture in simple interrupted fashion, the conjoint tendon was approximated to the ilioinguinal ligament capturing a little bit of the floor of the transversalis fascia.  Once this was done, the external oblique was closed over, reapproximated again with a #2-0 Ethibond suture catching each hump in between each repair from the prior floor repair.  This was done in simple interrupted fashion as well.  Next Scarpa's fascia was reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl suture.

Open reduction and internal screw fixation right fifth metatarsal.,2.  Application of short leg splint.,ANESTHESIA:,  TIVA/local.,HISTORY: , This 32-year-old female presents to Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for open reduction and internal fixation of a fractured right fifth metatarsal.  The patient relates that approximately in mid-June that she was working as a machinist at Detroit Diesel and dropped a large set of tools on her right foot.  She continued to walk on the foot and found nothing was wrong despite the pain.  She was recently seen by Dr. X and was referred to Dr. Y for surgery.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure had been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. Y.  The consent is available on the chart for review.  The urine beta was taken in the preoperative area and was negative.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to perform an infiltrative type block to the right fifth metatarsal area of the right foot.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field and a sterile stocking was reflected.  Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal base.  The Xi-scan and fluoroscopic unit was used to visualize the fractured fifth metatarsal.  An avulsion fracture of the right fifth metatarsal base was visualized.  The fracture was linear in nature from distal lateral to proximal medial.  There appeared to be a pseudoarthrosis on the lateral view.  A skin scrub was used to carefully mark out all the landmarks including the peroneus longus and brevis tendons in the fifth metatarsal and the sural nerve.  A linear incision was created with a #10 blade.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  All small veins traversing the subcutaneous tissue were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, using combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the deep fascia was reached.  Next a linear capsuloperiosteal incision was made down to the bone using a #15 blade.  Next, using a periosteal elevator and a #15 blade, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were stripped from the bone.  The fracture site was not clearly visualized due to bony callus.  A #25 gauge needle was introduced into the fracture site under fluoroscopy.  The fracture site was easily found.  An osteotome was used to separate the pseudoarthrosis.,A curette was used to remove the hypertrophic excessive pseudoarthrotic bone.  Next, a small ball burr was used to resect the remaining hypertrophic bone.  Next, a #1.0 drill bit was used to drill the subchondral bone on either side of the fracture site and a good healthy bleeding bone.  Next, a bone clamp was applied and the fracture was reduced.  Next, a threaded K-wire was thrown from the proximal base of the fifth metatarsal across the fracture site distally.  A #4-0 mm Synthes partially threaded, cannulated 50 mm screw was thrown using standard AO technique from the proximal fifth metatarsal base down the shaft and the fracture site was fixated rigidly.  All this was done under fluoroscopy.  Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The fracture site was found to have rigid compression.  The hypertrophic bone on the lateral aspect of the metatarsal was reduced with a ball burr and the wound was again flushed.  Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  A few fibers of the peroneus brevis tendon that were stripped from the base of the proximal phalanx were reattached carefully with Vicryl.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted suture technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Prolene in a horizontal mattress technique.  A postoperative fluoroscopic x-ray was taken and the bony alignment was found to be intact and the screw placement had excellent appearance.  A dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4x4s, fluff, and Kerlix were applied.,A sterile stockinet was applied over the foot.  Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied to pad all bony prominences.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits.  Next, 4-inch, pre-moulded, well-padded posterior splint was applied.  The capillary refill time of the digits was less than three seconds.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  After anesthesia was reversed, she was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She was given Vicodin 5/500 mg #30 1-2 p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain, Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c., Keflex 500 mg #30 one p.o. t.i.d., till gone.

Bunionectomy with first metatarsal osteotomy base wedge type with internal screw fixation.,2.  Akin osteotomy with internal wire fixation of left foot.,HISTORY: , This 19-year-old Caucasian female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states she has had worsening bunion deformity for as long as she could not remember.  She does have a history of Charcot-Marie tooth disease and desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in a Mayo block type fashion surrounding the lower left first metatarsal.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating field.  The stockinette was reflected, the foot was cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  Approximately 5 cm incision was made dorsomedially over the first metatarsal.,The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The capsule over the first metatarsal phalangeal then was identified where a dorsal capsular incision was then created down to the level of bone.  Capsule and periosteum was reflected off the first metatarsal head.  At this time, the cartilage was inspected and noted to be white, shiny, and healthy cartilage.  There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence.  Attention was then directed to first interspace where a combination of blunt and sharp dissection was done to perform a standard lateral release.  The abductor tendon attachments were identified and transected.  The lateral capsulotomy was performed.  The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected.  Attention was then directed to the prominent medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw.  Intraoperative assessment of pes was performed and pes was noted to be normal.,At this time, a regional incision was carried more approximately about 1.5 cm.  The capsular incision was then extended and the proximal capsule and periosteum were reflected off the first metatarsal.  The first metatarsal cuneiform joint was identified.  A 0.45 K-wire was then inserted into the base of the first metatarsal approximately 1 cm from the first cuneiform joint perpendicular to the weightbearing surface.  This K-wire was used as an access guide for a Juvaro type oblique base wedge osteotomy.  The sagittal saw was then used to creat a closing base wedge osteotomy with the apex being proximal medial.  The osteotomy site was then feathered and tilted with tight estimation of the bony edges.  The cortical hinge was maintained.  A 0.27 x 24 mm screw was then inserted in a standard AO fashion.  At this time, there was noted to be tight compression of the osteotomy site.  A second 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted more distally in the standard AO fashion with compression noted.  The ________ angle was noted to be significantly released.  Reciprocating rasp was then used to smoothen any remaining sharp edges.  The 0.45 k-wire was removed.  The foot was loaded and was noted to fill the remaining abduction of the hallux.  At this time, it was incised to perform an Akin osteotomy.,Original incision was then extended distally approximately 1 cm.  The incision was then deepened down to the level of capsule over the base of the proximal phalanx.  Again care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The capsule was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx.  An Akin osteotomy was performed with the apex being lateral and the base being medial.  After where the bone was resected, it was feathered until tight compression was noted without tension at the osteotomy site.  Care was taken to preserve the lateral hinge.  At 1.5 wire passed and a drill was then used to create drill hole proximal and distally to the osteotomy site in order for passage of 28 gauge monofilament wire.  The #28 gauge monofilament wire was passed through the drill hole and tightened down until compression and tight ________ osteotomy site was noted.  The remaining edge of the wire was then buried in the medial most distal drill hole.  The area was then inspected and the foot was noted with significant reduction of the bunion deformity.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Capsule was closed with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl in order to decrease tension of the incision site.  A running #5-0 subcuticular stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Total of 1 cc dexamethasone phosphate was then injected into the surgical site.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  Posterior splint was then placed on the patient in the operating room.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred back to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.  The patient was given postoperative instructions to be strictly nonweightbearing on the left foot.

328,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral progressive conductive hearing losses with probable otosclerosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral conductive hearing losses with right stapedial fixation secondary to otosclerosis.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Right argon laser assisted stapedectomy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room.  Endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. The patient's right ear was carefully prepped and then draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Slow infiltration of the external canal accomplished with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  The earlobe was also infiltrated with the same solution.  A limited incision was made in the earlobe harvesting a small bit of fat from the earlobe that was diced and the donor site closed with interrupted sutures of 5-0 nylon.  This could later be removed in bishop.  A reinspection of the ear canal was accomplished.  A 65 Beaver blade was used to make incision both at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock.  Jordan round knife was used to incise the tympanomeatal flap with an adequate cuff for later reapproximation.  Elevation was carried down to the fibrous annulus.  An annulus elevator was used to complete the elevation beneath the annular ligament.  The tympanic membrane and the associated flap rotated anteriorly exposing the ossicular chain.  Palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified.  Palpation with a fine curved needle on the stapes itself revealed no movement.  A house curette was used to takedown portions of the scutum with extreme care to avoid any inadvertent trauma to the chorda tympani.  The nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well.  The self-retaining speculum holder was used to get secure visibility and argon laser then used to create rosette on the posterior cruse.  The stapes superstructure anteriorly was mobilized with a right angle hook at the incostapedial joint and the superstructure could then be downfractured.  The fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation.  A small bit of additional footplate was removed with a right angle hook to accommodate the 0.6 mm piston.  The measuring device was used and a 4.25 mm slim shaft wire Teflon piston chosen.  It was placed in the middle ear atraumatically with a small alligator forceps and was directed towards the fenestration in the footplate.  The hook was placed over the incus and measurement appeared to be appropriate.  A downbiting crimper was then used to complete the attachment of the prosthesis to the incus.  Prosthesis is once again checked for location and centering and appeared to be in ideal position.  Small pledgets of fat were placed around the perimeter of the piston in an attempt to avoid any postoperative drainage of perilymph.  A small pledget of fat was also placed on the top of the incudo-prosthesis junction.  The mobility appeared excellent.  The flap was placed back in its normal anatomic position.  The external canal packed with small pledgets of Gelfoam and antibiotic ointment.  She was then awakened and taken to the recovery room in a stable condition with discharge anticipated later this day to Bishop.  Sutures will be out in a week and a recheck in Reno in four to five weeks from now.",Surgery
302,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Persistent abnormal uterine bleeding after endometrial ablation.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Persistent abnormal uterine bleeding after endometrial ablation.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) with a right salpingo-oophorectomy.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 250 cc.,FLUIDS:  ,1500 cc of crystalloids.,URINE: , 125 cc of clear urine at the end of the procedure.,FINDINGS: , On exam, under anesthesia, an obese female with an enlarged fibroid uterus freely movable on the pelvis.  Operative findings demonstrated the same with normal appearing tubes bilaterally.  The right ovary contained a right ovarian cyst.  The left ovary appeared to be within normal limits.  The peritoneal surfaces were noted to be within normal limits.  The bowel was also noted to be within normal limits.,INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 44-year-old female who had an endometrial ablation done in May, which showed submucosal fibroids.  She had history of anemia and has been on iron therapy.  She started having bleeding three weeks ago with intermittent bouts of flooding.,She desired permanent and definitive therapy and therefore it was felt very appropriate to take the patient for a total abdominal hysterectomy.  The uterus, cervix, and right tube and ovary was sent to pathology for review.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's term.  She was taken to the operating room where a general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was examined under anesthesia with noted findings above.  She was placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first knife and was then carried down to the underlying layer of the fascia.  With the second knife, the fascia was excised in the midline and extended laterally with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with the Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the fascial incision, which in a similar fashion was tented up and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline, the peritoneum was identified, entered bluntly and digitally.  Then the peritoneal incision was then extended superior and inferiorly with excellent visualization of the bladder.  The GYN Balfour was then placed.  A Lahey clamp was placed on the fundus of the uterus to pull the uterus into the operative field and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  Attention was then turned to the round ligaments bilaterally, which were tented up with Allis clamps and then a hemostat was poked through the avascular portion underneath the round ligament and the #O-tie was passed through and then tied down.  Then the round ligament was transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  The round ligaments were then skeletonized to create a window in the broad ligament.  The right infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated through the window created from the round ligaments and then the infundibular ligament on the right was loop tied and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and then transected and suture ligated with a #0 Vicryl in a Heaney stitch fashion.  It was noted to be hemostatic.  Attention was then turned to the left side, in which the uterovarian vessel was isolated and then tied with an #O-tie and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps, transected and suture ligated with a #0 Vicryl in a Heaney stitch fashion and noted to be hemostatic.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then identified, tented up with Allis clamps, and then the bladder flap was created sharply with a Russian and Metzenbaum scissors.  Then the bladder was deflected off of the underlying cervix with blunt dissection with a moist Ray-Tec sponge down to the level of the cervix.,The uterine vessels were skeletonized bilaterally and then clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  In the similar fashion, the broad ligament down to the level of the caudal ligament, the uterosacral ligaments was clamped with curved Ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated, and noted to be hemostatic.  The second Lahey clamp was then placed on the cervix.  The cervix was tented up and the pubocervical vesical fascia was transected with a long knife and then the vagina was entered with a double pointed scissors poked through well protecting posteriorly with a large malleable.  The cuff was then outlined.  The vaginal cuff was grasped with a Ochsner clamp and then the cervix, uterus, and the right tube and ovary were transected using the Jorgenson scissors.  The cuff outlined with Ochsner clamps.  The cuff was then painted with a Betadine soaked Ray-Tec sponge and the sponge was placed over the vagina.  The vaginal cuff was then closed with a #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion holding on to the beginning end on the right side as well as incorporating the ipsilateral cardinal ligaments into the cuff angles.  A long Allis was then used to grasp the mid portion of the cuff and a #0 Vicryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed in the mid portion of the cuff and tied down.  At this time, the abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic.  The suture that was used to close the cuff was then used to come back through the posterior peritoneum grabbing the uterosacral ligaments and the mid portion of the cuff, and then tied down to bring the cuff close and together.  Then, the right round ligament was pulled into the cuff and tied down with the #0 Vicryl that was used as a figure-of-eight stitch in the middle of the cuff.  The left round ligament was too small to reach the cuff.  The abdomen was then again copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic.  The peritoneum was then re-peritonealized with a #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The GYN Balfour and all packing sponges were removed from the abdomen.  Then the abdomen was then once again copiously irrigated and the cuff and incision sites were once again reinspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The ______ was placed back into the hollow of the sacrum.  The omentum was then pulled over to top of the bowel and then the peritoneum was then closed with a #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion and then the fascia was closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The skin was closed with staples and dressing applied.  The patient was then examined at the end of the procedure.  The Betadine-soaked sponge was removed from the vagina.  The cuff was noted to be intact without bleeding and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2 and she was taken to the recovery in stable condition.  The patient will be followed throughout her hospital stay.",Surgery

She has been unresponsive to conservative measures.  All risks, complications, anticipated benefits, and postoperative course were discussed.  The patient has agreed to proceed with surgery as described below.,GROSS FINDINGS: , There was noted to be eburnation and wear along the patellofemoral joint and femoral tibial articulation medially and laterally with osteophyte formation and sclerosis.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The Zimmer NexGen total knee system was utilized.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room #2 and placed in supine position on the operating room table.  She was administered spinal anesthetic by Dr. Z.,The tourniquet was placed about the proximal aspect of the right lower extremity.  The right lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right lower extremity and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  Longitudinal incision was made over the anterior aspect of the right knee.  Subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected.  A medial parapatellar retinacular incision was made.  The patella was then everted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated.  A drill hole was placed in the distal aspect of the femur and the distal femoral cutting guides were positioned in place.  The appropriate cuts were made at the distal femur as well as with use of the chamfer guide.  The trial femoral component was then positioned in place and noted to have good fit.  Attention was then directed to proximal tibia, the external tibial alignment guide was positioned in place and the proximal tibial cut was made demonstrating satisfactory cut.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments remained intact throughout the procedure as well as the posterior cruciate ligaments.  The remnants of the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci were resected.  The tibial trial was positioned in place.  Intraoperative radiographs were taken, demonstrating satisfactory alignment of the tibial cut.  The tibial holes were then drilled.  The patella was then addressed with the Bovie used to remove the soft tissue around the perimeter of the patella.  The patellar cutting guide was positioned in place and the posterior aspect of the patella was resected to the appropriate thickness.  Three drill holes were made within the patella after it was determined that 35 mm patella would be most appropriate.  The knee was placed through range of motion with the trial components marked and then the appropriate components obtained.  The tibial tray was inserted with cement, backed it into place, excess methylmethacrylate was removed.  The femoral component was inserted with methylmethacrylate.  Any excessive methylmethacrylate and bony debris were removed from the joint.  Trial Poly was positioned in place and the knee was held in full extension while the methylmethacrylate became firm.  The methylmethacrylate was also used at the patella.  The prosthesis was positioned in place.  The patellar clamp held securely till the methylmethacrylate was firm.  After all three components were in place, the knee was then again in placed range of motion and there appeared to be some torsion to the proximal tibial component and concerned regarding the alignment.  This component was removed and revised to a stemmed component with better alignment and position.  The previous component removed, the methylmethacrylate was removed.  Further irrigation was performed and then a stemmed template was positioned in place with the intramedullary alignment guide positioned and the tibia drilled and broached.  The trial tibial stemmed component was positioned in place.  Knee was placed through range of motion and the tracking was better.  Actual component was then obtained, methyl methacrylate was placed within the tibia.  The stemmed tibial component was impacted into place with good fit.  The Poly was then positioned in place.  Knee held in full extension with compression longitudinally after methylmethacrylate was solidified.  The trial Poly was removed.  Wound was irrigated and the joint was inspected.  There was no debris.  Collateral ligaments and posterior cruciate ligaments remained intact.  Soft tissue balancing was done and a 17 mm Poly was then inserted with the knee and tibial and femoral components with good tracking as well as the patellar component.  The tourniquet was deflated.  Hemostasis was satisfactory.  A drain was placed into the depths of the wound.  The medial retinacular incision was closed with one Ethibond suture in interrupted fashion.  The knee was placed through range of motion and there was no undue tissue tension, good patellar tracking, no excessive soft tissue laxity or constrain.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 undyed Vicryl in interrupted fashion.  The skin was closed with surgical clips.  The exterior of the wound was cleansed as well padded dressing ABDs and ace wrap over the right lower extremity.  At the completion of the procedure, distal pulses were intact.  Toes were pink, warm, with good capillary refill.  Distal neurovascular status was intact.  Postoperative x-ray demonstrated satisfactory alignment of the prosthesis.  Prognosis is good in this 79-year-old female with a significant degenerative arthritis.",Surgery

He had a positive stress test and cardiac cath showed severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease including left main disease with preserved LV function.  He was advised surgical revascularization of his coronaries.,FINDINGS DURING THE PROCEDURE:  ,The aorta was free of any significant plaque in the ascending portion at the sites of cannulation and cross clamp.  Left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts were good quality conduits.  Radial artery graft was a smaller sized conduit, otherwise good quality.  All distal targets showed heavy plaque involvement with calcification present.  The smallest target was the PDA, which was about 1.5 mm in size.  All the other targets were about 2 mm in size or greater.  The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  He was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, Precedex drips.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes, bypass time was 120 minutes.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room and laid supine on the table.  After he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right IJ triple-lumen catheter and Cordis catheter, right radial A-line, Foley catheter, TEE probes were placed and interfaced appropriately.  The patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest.,After prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion, proper time-out was conducted and site identification was performed, and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed.  Left internal mammary artery was taken down.  Simultaneously, left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques.  Simultaneously, endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques.  Subsequent to harvest, the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure.,Heparin was given.  Pericardium was opened and suspended.  During the takedown of the left internal mammary artery, it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally.  Only a limited dissection was performed to free up the lung from the mediastinal structures to accommodate the left internal mammary artery.,Pericardium was opened and suspended.  Pursestring sutures were placed.  Aortic and venous as well as antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia cannulation was performed and the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass.  With satisfactory flow, the aorta was cross clamped and the heart was arrested using a combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia.  An initial dose of about 1500 mL was given and this was followed by intermittent doses given both antegrade and retrograde throughout the procedure to maintain a good arrest and to protect the heart.,PDA was exposed first.  The right coronary artery was calcified along its course all the way to its terminal bifurcation.  Even in the PDA, calcification was noted in a spotty fashion.  Arteriotomy on the PDA was performed in a soft area and 1.5 probe was noted to be accommodated in both directions.  End radial to side PDA anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, the posterolateral obtuse marginal was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end saphenous vein to side obtuse marginal anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  This graft was then apposed to the diagonal and corresponding arteriotomy and venotomies were performed and a diamond shaped side-to-side anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, a slit was made in the left side of the pericardium and LIMA was accommodated in the slit on its way to the LAD.  LAD was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end LIMA to side LAD anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  LIMA was tacked down to the epicardium securely utilizing its fascial pedicle.,Two stab incisions were made in the ascending aorta and enlarged using 4-mm punch.  Two proximal anastomosis were constructed between the proximal end of the saphenous vein graft and the side of the aorta, and the proximal end of the radial artery graft and the side of the aorta separately using running 6-0 Prolene.  The patient was given terminal dose of warm retrograde followed by antegrade cardioplegia during which de-airing maneuvers were performed.  Following this, the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart was noted to resume spontaneous coordinated contractile activity.  Temporary V-pacing wires were placed.  Blake drains were placed in the left chest, the right chest, as well as in the mediastinum.  Left chest Blake drain was placed just in the medial section where dissection had been performed.  After an adequate period of rewarming during which time, temporary V-pacing wires were also placed, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  With satisfactory hemodynamics, good LV function on TEE and baseline EKG, heparin was reversed using protamine.  Decannulation was performed after volume resuscitation.  Hemostasis was assured.  Mediastinal and pericardial fat and pericardium were loosely reapproximated in the midline and chest was closed in layers using interrupted stainless steel wires to reappose the two sternal halves, heavy Vicryl for musculofascial closure, and Monocryl for subcuticular skin closure.

2057,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe degenerative joint disease of the right shoulder.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Severe degenerative joint disease of the right shoulder.,PROCEDURE: , Right shoulder hemi-resurfacing using a size 5 Biomet Copeland humeral head component, noncemented.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 100 mL.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.  The patient was taken to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 55-year-old female who has had increased pain in to her right shoulder.  X-rays as well as an MRI showed a severe arthritic presentation of the humeral head with mild arthrosis of the glenoid.  She had an intact rotator cuff being at a young age and with potential of glenoid thus it was felt that a hemi-resurfacing was appropriate for her right shoulder focusing in the humeral head.  All risks, benefits, expectations and complications of surgery were explained to her in detail including nerve and vessel damage, infection, potential for hardware failure, the need for revision surgery with potential of some problems even with surgical intervention.  The patient still wanted to proceed forward with surgical intervention.  The patient did receive 1 g of Ancef preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operating table.  The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well.  The patient was moved to a beach chair position.  All extremities were well padded.  Her head was well padded to the table.  Her right upper extremity was draped in sterile fashion.  A saber incision was made from the coracoid down to the axilla.  Skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the cephalic vein was retracted as well as all neurovascular structures were retracted in the case.  Dissecting through the deltopectoral groove, the subscapularis tendon was found as well as the bicipital tendon, 1 finger breadth medial to the bicipital tendon an incision was made.  Subscapularis tendon was released.  The humeral head was brought in to; there were large osteophytes that were removed with an osteotome.  The glenoid then was evaluated and noted to just have mild arthrosis, but there was no need for surgical intervention in this region.  A sizer was placed.  It was felt that size 5 was appropriate for this patient, after which the guide was used to place the stem and pin.  This was placed, after which a reamer was placed along the humeral head and reamed to a size 5.  All extra osteophytes were excised.  The supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were intact.  Next, the excess bone was removed and irrigated after which reaming of the central portion of the humeral head was performed of which a trial was placed and showed that there was adequate fit and appropriate fixation.  The arm had excellent range of motion.  There are no signs of gross dislocation.  Drill holes were made into the humeral head after which a size 5 Copeland hemi-resurfacing component was placed into the humeral head, kept down in appropriate position, had excellent fixation into the humeral head.  Excess bone that had been reamed was placed into the Copeland metal component, after which this was tapped into position.  After which the wound site was copiously irrigated with saline and antibiotics and the humeral head was reduced and taken through range of motion; had adequate range of motion, full internal and external rotation as well as forward flexion and abduction.  There was no gross sign of dislocation.  Wound site once again it was copiously irrigated with saline antibiotics.  The subscapularis tendon was approximated back into position with #2 Ethibond after which the bicipital tendon did have significant tear to it; therefore it was tenodesed in to the pectoralis major tendon.  After which, the wound site again was irrigated with saline antibiotics after which subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with staples.  A sterile dressing was placed.  The patient was awakened from general anesthetic and transferred to hospital gurney to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.",Orthopedic

The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  Examination under anesthesia revealed an anteverted uterus and no adnexal masses.  The patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Foley catheter was placed in the patient's bladder.  The patient's cervix was visualized with speculum.  A single-tooth tenaculum was placed on the anterior lip of the cervix.  A HUMI uterine manipulator was placed through the internal os of the cervix and the balloon was inflated.  The tenaculum and speculum were then removed from the vagina.  Attention was then turned to the patient's abdomen where a small infraumbilical incision was made with scalpel.  Veress needle was placed through this incision and the patient's abdomen was inflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  Veress needle was removed and then 5-mm trocar was placed through the umbilical incision.  Laparoscope was placed through this incision and the patient's abdominal contents were visualized.  A 2nd trocar incision was placed in the midline 2 cm above the symphysis pubis and a 5-mm trocar was placed through this incision on direct visualization for laparoscope.  A trocar incision was made in the right lower quadrant.  A 10-mm trocar was placed through this incision under direct visualization with the laparoscope.  A ___ trocar incision was made in the left lower quadrant and a 2nd 10-mm trocar was placed through this incision under direct visualization with the laparoscope.  The patient's abdominal and pelvic anatomy were again visualized with the assistance of a blunt probe.  The Gyrus cautery was used to cauterize and cut the right and left round ligaments.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament was bluntly dissected and cauterized and cut in an inferior fashion towards lower uterine segment.  The right uteroovarian ligament was cauterized and cut using the Gyrus.  The uterine vessels were then bluntly dissected.  The Gyrus was then used to cauterize the right uterine vessels.  Gyrus was then used on the left side to cauterize and cut the left round ligament.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament on the left side was bluntly dissected, cauterized, and cut.  Using the Gyrus, the left uteroovarian ligament was cauterized and cut and the left uterine vessels were then bluntly dissected.  The left uterine vessels were then cauterized and cut using the Gyrus.  At this point, as the uterine vessels had been cauterized on both sides, the uterine body exhibited blanching.  At this point, the Harmonic scalpel hook was used to amputate the uterine body from the cervix at the level just below the uterine vessels.  The HUMI manipulator was removed prior to amputation of the uterine body.  After the uterine body was detached from the cervical stump, morcellation of the uterine body was performed using the uterine morcellator.  The uterus was removed in a piecemeal fashion through the right lower quadrant trocar incision.  Once, all fragments of the uterus were removed from the abdominal cavity, the pelvis was irrigated.  The Harmonic scalpel was used to cauterize the remaining endocervical canal.  The cervical stump was also cauterized with the Harmonic scalpel and good hemostasis was noted at the cervical stump and also at the sites of all pedicles.  The Harmonic scalpel was then used to incise the right ovarian simple cyst.  The right ovarian cyst was then drained yielding straw-colored fluid.  The site of right ovarian cystotomy was noted to be hemostatic.  The pelvis was again inspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The ureters were identified on both sides and noted to be intact throughout the visualized course.  All instruments were then removed from the patient's abdomen and the abdomen was deflated.  The fascial defects at the 10-mm trocar sites were closed using figure-of-8 sutures of 0-Vicryl and skin incisions were closed with a 4-0 Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  The cervix was then visualized with the speculum.  Good hemostasis at the site of tenaculum insertion was obtained using silver nitrate sticks.  All instruments were removed from the patient's vagina and the patient was placed in normal supine position.,Sponge, lap, needle, and instrument counts were correct x2.  The patient was awoken from anesthesia and then transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",Surgery

She has heavy periods lasting 7 to 14 days with spotting in between her periods.  The patient's uterus is 12.2 x 6.2 x 5.3 cm.  Her endometrial thickness is 2 cm.  Her adnexa is within normal limits.  The patient and I had a long discussion.  Consent was reviewed in layman's terms.  The patient understood the foreseeable risks and complications, the alternative treatments and procedure itself and recovery.  Questions were answered.  The patient was taken back to the operative suite.  The patient underwent pelvic examination and then carefully placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had excellent femoral pulses and there was no excessive extension or hyperflexion of the lower extremities.  The patient's history is that she is at risk for development of condyloma.  The patient's husband was found to have a laryngeal papillomatosis.  She has had a laparotomy, which is an infraumbilical incision appendectomy, a laparoscopy, and bilateral tubal ligation.  Her uterus appears to be mobile by 12-week size.  There is a good descend.  There appears to be no adnexal abnormalities.  Uterus is 12-week sized and has fibroids, it is boggy and probably has a component of adenomyosis.  The patient's cervix was dilated without difficulty utilizing Circon ACMI hysteroscope with a 12-degree lens.  The patient underwent hysteroscopy.  The outflow valve was opened at all times.  The inflow valve was opened just to achieve appropriate distension.  The patient did have no evidence of trauma of the cervix.  No Trendelenburg as we were in room #9.  The patient also had the bag held two fingerbreadths above the level of the heart.  The patient was seen.  There is a 2 x 3 cm focal thickening of the posterior wall of the uterus' endometrial lining, a more of a polypoid nature.  The patient also has one in the fundal area.  The thickened tissue was removed via sharp curettage.  Therefore, we reinserted the hysteroscope.  It appeared that there was an appropriate curettage and that all areas of suspicion were indeed removed.  The patient's procedure was ended with specimen being obtained and sent to Department of Pathology.  We will follow her up in the office.",SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes
920,"HISTORY: , This patient with prenatal care in my office who did have some preterm labor and was treated with nifedipine and was stable on nifedipine and bed rest; unfortunately, felt decreased fetal movement yesterday, 12/29/08, presented to the hospital for evaluation on the evening of 12/29/08.  At approximately 2030 hours and on admission, no cardiac activity was noted by my on-call partner, Dr. X.  This was confirmed by Dr. Y with ultrasound and the patient was admitted with a diagnosis of intrauterine fetal demise at 36 weeks' gestation.,SUMMARY:,  She was admitted.  She was 3 cm dilated on admission.  She desired induction of labor.  Therefore, Pitocin was started.  Epidural was placed for labor pain.  She did have a temperature of 100.7 and antibiotics were ordered including gentamicin and clindamycin secondary to penicillin allergy.  She remained febrile, approximately 100.3.  She then progressed.  On my initial exam at approximately 0730 hours, she was 3 to 4 cm dilated.  She had reported previously some mucous discharge with no ruptured membranes.  Upon my exam, no membranes were noted.  Attempted artificial rupture of membranes was performed.  No fluid noted and there was no fluid discharge noted all the way until the time of delivery.  Intrauterine pressure catheter was placed at that time to document there are adequate pressures on contraction secondary to induction of labor.  She progressed well and completely dilated, pushed approximately three times, and proceeded with delivery.,DELIVERY NOTE:,  Delivery is a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery of an intrauterine fetal demise.  Fetal position is right occiput anterior.,COMPLICATIONS: , Again, intrauterine fetal demise.  Placenta delivery spontaneous.  Condition was intact with a three-vessel cord.  Lacerations; she had a small right periurethral laceration as well as a small second-degree midline laceration.  These were both repaired postdelivery with 4-0 Vicryl on an SH and a 3-0 Vicryl on a CT-1 respectively.  Estimated blood loss was 200 mL.,Infant is a male infant, appears grossly morphologically normal.  Apgars were 0 and 0.  Weight pending at this time.,NARRATIVE OF DELIVERY:,  I was called.  This patient was completely dilated.  I arrived.  She pushed for three contractions.  She was very comfortable.  She delivered the fetal vertex in the right occiput anterior position followed by the remainder of the infant.  There was a tight nuchal cord x1 that was reduced after delivery of the fetus.  Cord was doubly clamped.  The infant was transferred to a bassinet cleaned by the nursing staff en route.  The placenta delivered spontaneously, was carefully examined, found to be intact.  No signs of abruption.  No signs of abnormal placentation or abnormal cord insertion.  The cord was examined and a three-vessel cord was confirmed.  At this time, IV Pitocin and bimanual massage.  Fundus firm as above with minimal postpartum bleeding.  The vagina and perineum were carefully inspected.  A small right periurethral laceration was noted, was repaired with a 4-0 Vicryl on an SH needle followed by a small second-degree midline laceration, was repaired in a normal running fashion with a 3-0 Vicryl suture.  At this time, the repair is intact.  She is hemostatic.  All instruments and sponges were removed from the vagina and the procedure was ended.,Father of the baby has seen the baby at this time and the mother is waiting to hold the baby at this time.  We have called pastor in to baptize the baby as well as calling social work.  They are deciding on a burial versus cremation, have decided against autopsy at this time.  She will be transferred to postpartum for her recovery.  She will be continued on antibiotics secondary to fever to eliminate endometritis and hopefully will be discharged home tomorrow morning.,All of the care and findings were discussed in detail with Christine and Bryan and at this time obviously they are very upset and grieving, but grieving appropriately and understanding the findings and the fact that there is not always a known cause for a term fetal demise.  I have discussed with her that we will do some blood workup postdelivery for infectious disease profile and clotting disorders.",Surgery

Calcium was slightly low at 7.8.  The patient has had ionized calcium checked at Munson that was normal at 4.5 prior to her discharge.  Troponin is negative x2 from 2100 and repeat at 07:32.  This morning, her BNP was 163 at admission.  Her admission chest x-ray was unremarkable and did not show evidence of cardiomegaly to suggest pericardial effusion.  Her current EKG tracing from 05:42 shows a sinus bradycardia with Wolff-Parkinson White Pattern, a rate of 58 beats per minute, and a corrected QT interval of 557 milliseconds.  Her PR interval was 0.12.,We received a call from Munson Medical Center that a bed had been arranged for the patient.  I contacted Dr. Varner and we reviewed the patient's managed to this point.  All combined impression is that the patient was likely to not have had actual ventricular tachycardia.  This is based on her EP study from October showing her to be non-inducible.  In addition, she had a cardiac catheterization that showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  What is most likely that the patient has postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Her WPW may have degenerated into a ventricular tachycardia, but this is unlikely.  At this point, we will convert the patient from IV amiodarone to oral amiodarone and obtain an echocardiogram to verify that she does not have evidence of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period.  I will recheck her potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus at this point and make adjustments if indicated.

The patient has a family history of breast cancer within her mother at age 58.  Patient denies personal history of breast cancer.,TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  ,Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy.  An additional lateromedial projection of the right breast was obtained.  The breasts demonstrate heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue.  Within the upper outer aspect of the left breast, there is evidence of a circumscribed density measuring approximately 1 cm x 0.7 cm in diameter.  No additional dominant mass, areas of architectural distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen.  Multiple additional benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally.  Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable.,Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder.  This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow.  This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.,Additional ultrasonographic imaging of the left breast demonstrates a complex circumscribed solid and cystic lesion with hypervascular properties at the 2 o'clock position, measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter.  At this time, the lesion was determined to be amenable by ultrasound-guided core biopsy.,The risks and complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient for biopsy of the solid and cystic lesion of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast.  Informed consent was obtained.  The lesion was re-localized under ultrasound guidance.  The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  2% lidocaine was administered locally for anesthesia.  Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the distal aspect of the lesion.  A small skin nick was made.  Color Doppler surrounding the lesion demonstrates multiple vessels surrounding the lesion at all sides.  The lateral to medial approach was performed with an 11-gauge Mammotome device.  The device was advanced under ultrasound guidance, with the superior aspect of the lesion placed within the aperture.  Two core biopsies were obtained.  The third core biopsy demonstrated evidence of an expanding hypoechoic area surrounding the lesion, consistent with a rapidly-expanding hematoma.  Arterial blood was visualized exiting the access site.  A biopsy clip was attempted to be placed, however could not be performed secondary to the active hemorrhage.  Therefore, the Mammotome was removed, and direct pressure over the access site and biopsy location was applied for approximately 20 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  Postprocedural imaging of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast demonstrates evidence of a hematoma measuring approximately 1.9 x 4.4 x 1.3 cm in diameter.  The left breast was re-cleansed with a ChloraPrep, and a pressure bandage and ice packing were applied to the left breast.  The patient was observed in the ultrasound department for the following 30 minutes without complaints.  The patient was subsequently discharged with information and instructions on utilizing the ice bandage.  The obtained specimens were sent to pathology for further analysis.,IMPRESSION:,1.  A mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was accessed under ultrasound guidance utilizing a Mammotome core biopsy instrument, and multiple core biopsies were obtained.  Transient arterial hemorrhage was noted at the biopsy site, resulting in a localized 4 cm hematoma.  Pressure was applied until hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was monitored for approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, and was ultimately discharged in good condition.  The core biopsies were submitted to pathology for further analysis.,2.  Small isoechoic ovoid mass within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder does not demonstrate color flow, and likely represents fibrotic changes or a lipoma.,3.  Suspicious mammographic findings.  The circumscribed density measuring approximately 8 mm at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was subsequently biopsied.  Further pathologic analysis is pending.,BIRADS Classification 4 - Suspicious findings.,MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:,1.  A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography.,2.

4778,"NAME OF PROCEDURE,1.  Left heart catheterization with left ventriculography and selective coronary angiography.,2.  Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery.,HISTORY: , This is a 58-year-old male who presented with atypical chest discomfort.  The patient had elevated troponins which were suggestive of a myocardial infarction.  The patient is suspected of having significant obstructive coronary artery disease, therefore he is undergoing cardiac catheterization.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , Informed consent was given prior to the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory.  The patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory in postabsorptive state.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, 2% Xylocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right femoral region.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Then, the patient had already been on heparin.  Then, a Judkins left 4 catheter was intubated into the left main coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  A 3DRC catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  Then, a 3DRC guiding catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Then, a universal wire was advanced across the lesion into the distal right coronary artery.  Integrilin was given.  Then, a 3.0 x 12 Voyager balloon was inflated at 13 atmospheres for 30 seconds.  Then, a projection was obtained.  Then, a 3.0 x 15 Vision stent was placed into the distal right coronary artery.  The stent was deployed at 15 atmospheres for 25 seconds.  Post stent, the patient was given intracoronary nitroglycerin after one projection.  Then, there was an attempt to place the intervention wire across the third posterolateral branch which was partially obstructed and this was not successful.  Then, a pilot 150 wire was advanced across the lesion.  Then, attempt to place the 2.0 x 8 power saver across the lesion was performed.  However, it was felt that there was adequate flow and no further intervention needed to be performed.  Then, the stent delivery system was removed.  A pigtail catheter was placed into the left ventricle.  Hemodynamics followed by left ventriculography was performed.  Then, a pullback gradient was performed and the catheter was removed.  Then, the right femoral artery was visualized and using angiography and then an Angio-Seal was applied.  The patient was transferred back to his room in good condition.,FINDINGS,1.  Hemodynamics:  The opening aortic pressure was 116/61 with a mean of 64.  The opening left ventricular pressure was 112 with end-diastolic pressure of 23.  LV pressure on pullback was 106 with end-diastolic pressure of 21.  Aortic pressure was 111/67 with a mean of 87.  The closing pressure was 110/67.,2.  Left ventriculography:  The left ventricle was of normal cavity, size, and wall thickness.  There is a mild anterolateral hypokinesis and moderate inferior and inferoapical hypokinesis.  The overall systolic function appeared to be mildly reduced with ejection fraction between 40% and 45%.  The mitral valve had no significant prolapse or regurgitation.  The aortic valve appeared to be trileaflet and moved normally.,3.  Coronary angiography:  The left main is a normal-caliber vessel.  This bifurcates into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries.  The left main is free of any significant obstructive coronary artery disease.  The left anterior descending is a large vessel that extends to the apex.  It gives off approximately 10 septal perforators and 5 diagonal branches.  The first diagonal branch was large.  The left anterior descending had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  The left circumflex is a nondominant vessel, which gives rise to two obtuse marginal branches.  The two obtuse marginal branches are large.  There is a relatively small left atrial branch.  The left circumflex had a 50% stenosis after the first obtuse marginal branch.  The rest of the vessel is moderately irregular, but no high-grade disease.  The right coronary artery appears to be a dominant vessel, which gives rise to three right ventricular branches, four posterior lateral branches, two right atrial branches, and two small conus branches.  The right coronary artery had moderate disease in its proximal segment with multiple areas of plaquing but no high-grade disease.  However, distal between the second and third posterolateral branch, there is a 90% stenosis.  The rest of the vessels had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  Then percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the right coronary artery resulted in a 20% residual stenosis.  Then, after stent placement there was 0% residual stenosis; however, there was partial occlusion of the third posterolateral branch.  Then, a wire was advanced through this and there was improvement of flow.  There is improvement from TIMI grade 2 to TIMI grade 3 flow.,CLINICAL IMPRESSION,1.  Successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery.,2.  Two-vessel coronary artery disease.,3.  Elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.,4.

The C-arm was brought into the operative field and AP, left right oblique and lateral fluoroscopic images of the L1-2 through L5-S1 levels were obtained.  We then proceeded to prepare the low back with a Betadine solution and draped sterile.  Using an oblique approach to the spine, the L5-S1 level was addressed using an oblique projection angled C-arm in order to allow for perpendicular penetration of the disc space.  A metallic marker was then placed laterally and a needle entrance point was determined.  A skin wheal was raised with 1% Xylocaine and an #18-gauge needle was advanced up to the level of the disc space using AP, oblique and lateral fluoroscopic projections.  A second needle, #22-gauge 6-inch needle was then introduced into the disc space and with AP and lateral fluoroscopic projections, was placed into the center of the nucleus.  We then proceeded to perform a similar placement of needles at the L4-5, L3-4 and L2-3 levels.,A solution of Isovue 300 with 1 gm of Ancef was then drawn into a 10 cc syringe and without informing the patient of our injecting, we then proceeded to inject the disc spaces sequentially.",Surgery

After local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine, 6-French sheath was inserted in the right femoral artery and 7-French sheath was inserted in the right femoral vein.  Then right heart cath was performed using 7-French Swan-Ganz catheter.  Catheter was placed in the pulmonary capillary wedge position.  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, PA pressure was obtained, cardiac output was obtained, then RV, RA pressures were obtained.  The right heart catheter _______ pulled out.  Then selective coronary angiography was performed using 6-French JL4 and 6-French 3DRC catheter.  Then attempt was made to cross the aortic valve with 6-French pigtail catheter, but it was unsuccessful.  After the procedure, catheters were pulled out, sheath was pulled out and hemostasis was obtained by manual pressure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.,HEMODYNAMICS:,1.  Cardiac output was 4.9 per liter per minute.

KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty at T12 and L1evels Insertion of KYPHON HV-R bone cement under low pressure at T12 and L1 levels.,2.  Bone biopsy (medically necessary).,ANESTHESIA:, General,COMPLICATIONS:, None,BLOOD LOSS:, Minimal,INDICATIONS:,  Mrs. Smith is a 75-year-old female who has had severe back pain that began approximately three months ago and is debilitating.  She has been unresponsive to nonoperative treatment modalities including bed rest and analgesics.  She presents with and is on medication therapy for COPD, diabetes and hypertension (other co-morbidities may be present upon admission and should be documented in the operative note).,Radiographic imaging including MRI confirms multiple compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine including T12, L1 and L2.  In addition to the fractures, she presents with kyphotic posture.  Films on 1/04 demonstrated L1 and L2 osteoporotic fractures.  Films on 2/04 demonstrated increased loss of height at L1.  Films on 3/04 demonstrated a new compression fracture at T12 and further collapse of L1.  The L2 fracture is documented on radiographic studies as being chronic and a year or more old.  The T12 fracture has the most significant kyphotic deformity.  Based on these findings, we have decided to perform KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty on the L1 and T12 fractures.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room/radiology suite and general anesthesia/local sedation with endotracheal intubation was performed.  The patient was positioned prone on the Jackson table.  The back was prepped and draped.  The image intensifier (C-arm) was brought into position and the T12 pedicles were identified and marked with a skin marker.  In view of the collapse of T12, a transpedicular approach to the vertebral body was appropriate.  An 11-gauge needle was advanced through the T12 pedicle to the junction of the pedicle and vertebral body on the right side.  Positioning was confirmed on the AP and lateral plane.  Following satisfactory placement of the needle, the stylet was removed.  A guide pin was inserted through the 11g to a point 3mm from the anterior cortex.  AP and lateral images were taken to verify position and trajectory.  Alongside of the guide pin a 1-cm paramedian incision was made.  The needle was then removed leaving the guide pin in place.  The osteointroducer was placed over the guide pin and advanced through the pedicle.  Once I was at the junction of the pedicle and the vertebral body, a lateral image was taken to insure that the cannula was positioned approximately 1cm past the vertebral body wall.  Through the cannula, a drill was advanced into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic guidance toward the anterior cortex, creating a channel.  The anterior cortex was probed with the guide pin to ensure no perforations in the anterior cortex.  After completing the entry into the vertebral body, a 15 mm inflatable bone tamp was inserted through the cannula and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body near the anterior cortex.  The radiopaque marker bands on the bone tamp were identified using AP and lateral images.  The above sequence of instrument placement was then repeated on the left side of the T12 vertebral body.  Once both bone tamps were in position, they were inflated to 0.5 cc and 50 psi.  Expansion of the bone tamps was done sequentially in increments of 0.25 to 0.5 cc of contrast, with careful attention being paid to the inflation pressures and balloon position.  The inflation was monitored with AP and lateral imaging.  The final balloon volume was 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left.  There was no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body.  Direct reduction of the fracture was achieved, end plate movement was noted and approximately 5 mm of height restoration was achieved.  Under fluoroscopic imaging, and the use of the bone void fillers, internal fixation was achieved through a low-pressure injection of KYPHON HV-R bone cement.  The cavity was filled with a total volume of 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left side.  Once the bone cement had hardened, the cannulas were then removed.,At this time, we proceeded to perform a balloon kyphoplasty at L1 using the same sequence of steps as on T12.  An entry needle was placed bilaterally through the pedicle into the vertebral body, a cortical window was created, inflation of the bone tamps directly reduced the fracture, the bone tamps were removed, and internal fixation by bone void filler insertion was achieved.  Throughout the procedure, AP and lateral imaging monitored positioning.,Post-procedure, all incisions were closed with sutures.  The patient was kept in the prone position for approximately 10 minutes post cement injection.  She was then turned supine, monitored briefly and returned to the floor.  She was moving both her lower extremities at this time.,Throughout the procedure, there were no intraoperative complications.  Estimated blood loss was minimal.",Orthopedic

This loose body was then subsequently removed.  It measured 24 x 14 mm.  This was actually the OCD lesion seen on the MRI that had come from the weightbearing surface of just the lateral posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: , The patient is 13-year-old male with persistent left knee pain.  He was initially seen at Sierra Pacific Orthopedic Group where an MRI demonstrated unstable OCD lesion of the left knee.  The patient presented here for a second opinion.  Surgery was recommended grossly due to the instability of the fragment.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, possible need for other surgical procedures, and possible early arthritis.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above plan.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  The standard portals were marked on the skin.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The portal incisions were then made by an #11 blade.  Camera was inserted into the lateral joint line.  There was a noted large cartilage loose body in the suprapatellar pouch.  This was subsequently removed with extension of the anterolateral portal.  Visualization of the rest of the knee revealed significant synovitis.  The patient had a large cartilage defect in the posterolateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle.  The remainder of the knee demonstrated no other significant cartilage lesions, loose bodies, plica or meniscal pathology.  ACL was also visualized to be intact in the intracondylar notch.,Attention was then turned back to the large defect.  The loose cartilage was debrided using a shaver.  Microfracture technique was then performed to 4 mm depth at 2 to 3 mm distances.  Tourniquet was released at the end of the case to ensure that there was fat and bleeding at the microfracture sites.  All instruments were then removed.  The portals were closed using #4-0 Monocryl.  A total of 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the knee.  Wounds were then cleaned and dried, and dressed in Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and bias.  The patient was then placed in a knee immobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The tourniquet was released at 37 minutes.  He was taken to recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The loose cartilage fragment was given to the family.  The intraoperative findings were relayed with intraoperative photos.  There was a large deficit in the weightbearing portion of medial femoral condyle.  His prognosis is guarded given the fact of the fragile lesion and location, but in advantages of his age and his rehab potential down the road, if the patient still has symptoms, he may be a candidate for osteochondral autograft, a procedure which is not performed at Children's or possible cartilaginous transplant.  All questions were answered.  The patient will follow up in 10 days, may wet the wound in 5 days.",Orthopedic

2019,"PROCEDURE:,  Subcutaneous ulnar nerve transposition.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,A curvilinear incision was made over the medial elbow, starting proximally at the medial intermuscular septum, curving posterior to the medial epicondyle, then curving anteriorly along the path of the ulnar nerve.  Dissection was carried down to the ulnar nerve.  Branches of the medial antebrachial and the medial brachial cutaneous nerves were identified and protected.,Osborne's fascia was released, an ulnar neurolysis performed, and the ulnar nerve was mobilized.  Six cm of the medial intermuscular septum was excised, and the deep periosteal origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris was released to avoid kinking of the nerve as it was moved anteriorly.,The subcutaneous plane just superficial to the flexor-pronator mass was developed.  Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery.  The nerve was transposed anteriorly, superficial to the flexor-pronator mass.  Motor branches were dissected proximally and distally to avoid tethering or kinking the ulnar nerve.,A semicircular medially based flap of flexor-pronator fascia was raised and sutured to the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to prevent the nerve from relocating.

The patient works in the Electronics/Robotics field and relates that he stepped on a wire at work, which somehow got into his shoe.  The wire entered his foot.  His family physician attempted to remove the wire, but it only became deeper in the foot.  The wound eventually healed, but a scar tissue was formed.  The patient has had constant pain with ambulation intermittently since the incident occurred.  He desires attempted surgical removal of the wire.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position with a safety strap placed across his waist for his protection.,A pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied about the right ankle over copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 12 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to administer an ankle block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the foot where approximately a 5 mm long cicatrix was palpated and visualized.  This was the origin and entry point of the previous puncture wound from the wire.  This cicatrix was found lateral to the plantar aspect of the first metatarsal between the first and second metatarsals in a nonweightbearing area.  Next, the Xi-scan was draped and brought into the operating room.  A #25 gauge needles under fluoroscopy were inserted into the plantar aspect of the foot and three planes to triangulate the wire.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make approximately a 3 cm curvilinear ""S""-shaped incision.  Next, the #15 blade was used to carry the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  The medial and lateral margins of the incision were undermined.  Due to the small nature of the foreign body and the large amount of fat on the plantar aspect of the foot, the wires seemed to serve no benefit other then helping with the incision planning.  Therefore, they were removed.  Once the wound was opened, a hemostat was used to locate the wire very quickly and the wire was clamped.  A second hemostat was used to clamp the wire.  A #15 blade was used to carefully transect the fatty tissue around the tip of the hemostats, which were visualized in the base of the wound.  The wire quickly came into visualization.  It measured approximately 4 mm in length and was approximately 1 mm in diameter.  The wire was green colored and metallic in nature.  It was removed with the hemostat and passed off as a specimen to be sent to Pathology for identification.  The wire was found at the level of deep fascia at the capsular level just plantar to the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament.  Next, copious amounts of sterile gentamicin impregnated saline was instilled in the wound for irrigation and the wound base was thoroughly cleaned and inspected.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to throw two simple interrupted deep sutures to remove the dead space.  Next, #4-0 Ethibond was used to close the skin in a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  The standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released.  There was immediate hyperemic flush to the digits noted.  The patient's anesthesia was reversed.  He tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  The patient was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.,Vital signs were stable and vascular status was intact to the right foot.  He was given OrthoWedge shoe.  Ice was applied behind the knee and his right lower extremity was elevated on to pillows.  He was given standard postoperative instructions consisting of rest, ice and elevation to the right lower extremity.  He is to be non-weightbearing for three weeks, at which time, the wound will be evaluated and sutures will be removed.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on 08/22/2003 and was given emergency contact number to call if problems arise.  He was given a prescription for Tylenol #4, #30 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain as well as Celebrex 200 mg #30 take two p.o. q.d. p.c., with 200 mg 12 hours later as a rescue dose.

Inflammatory synovitis from the volar radial wrist area.,2.  Inflammatory synovitis from the dorsal wrist area.,DRAINS:,  None.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , Patient brought to the operating room.  After induction of IV sedation a right upper extremity axillary block anesthetic was performed by anesthesia staff.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef preoperatively.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet.  Tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand positioned palm up in a lead hand-holder.  A longitudinal zigzag incision over the volar radial wrist mass was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Careful blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Antebrachial fascia was bluntly dissected and incised to reveal the radial artery.  Radial artery was mobilized preserving its dorsal and palmar branches.  Small transverse concomitant vein branches were divided to facilitate mobilization of the radial artery.  Wrist mass was exposed by blunt dissection.  This appeared to be an inflammatory arthritic mass from the volar radial wrist capsule.  This was debrided down to the wrist capsule with visualization of the joint through a small capsular window.  After complete volar synovectomy the capsular window was closed with 4-0 Mersilene figure-of-eight suture.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 PDS and the skin was closed with a running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Forearm was pronated and C-arm image intensifier was used to confirm localization of the radial styloid for marking of the skin incision.  An oblique incision overlying the radial styloid centered on the second extensor compartment was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to identify and protect the superficial radial nerve.  Blunt dissection was carried out in the extensor retinaculum.  This was incised longitudinally over the second extensor compartment.  EPL tendon was identified, mobilized and released to facilitate retraction and prevent injury.  The interval between the ECRL and the ECRB was developed down to bone.  Dorsal capsulotomy was made and local synovitis was identified.  This was debrided and sent as second pathologic specimen.  Articular surface of the scaphoid was identified and seen to be completely devoid of articular cartilage with hard, eburnated subchondral bone consistent with a SLAC pattern arthritis.  Radial styloid had extensive spurring and was exposed subperiosteally and osteotomized in a dorsal oblique fashion preserving the volar cortex as the attachment point of the deep volar carpal ligament layer.  Dorsally the styloidectomy was beveled smooth and contoured with a rongeur.  Final x-rays documenting the styloidectomy were obtained.  Local synovitis beneath the joint capsule was debrided.  Remnants of the scapholunate interosseous which was completely deteriorated were debrided.  The joint capsule was closed anatomically with 4-0 PDS and extensor retinaculum was closed with 4-0 PDS.  Subcutaneous tissues closed with 4-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Steri-Strips were applied to wound edge closure; 10 cc of 0.5% plain Marcaine was infiltrated into the areas of the surgical incisions and radial styloidectomy for postoperative analgesia.  A bulky gently compressive wrist and forearm bandage incorporating an EBI cooling pad were applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.

The patient reports that she has been having history of recurrent sinus infection, averages about three times per year.  During the time that she gets the sinus infections, she has nasal congestion, nasal drainage, and also generally develops an ear infection as well.  The patient does note that she has been having hearing loss.  This is particular prominent in the right ear now for the past three to four years.  She does note popping after blowing the nose.  Occasionally, the hearing will improve and then it plugs back up again.  She seems to be plugged within the nasal passage, more on the right side than the left and this seems to be year round issue with her.  She tried Flonase nasal spray to see if this help with this and has been taking it, but has not seen a dramatic improvement.  She has had a history of swallowing issues and that again secondary to the persistent postnasal drainage.  She feels that she is having a hard time swallowing at times as well.  She has complained of a lump sensation in the throat that tends to come and go.  She denies any cough, no hemoptysis, no weight change.  No night sweats, fever or chills has been noted.

All questions were answered.  The patient was brought to preoperative holding area where the operative right eye was marked.  He was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  EKG leads were placed.  General anesthesia was induced by the anesthesia service.  A time-out was called to confirm the procedure and operative eye.  The right operative eye was disinfected and draped in a standard fashion for eye surgery.  A lid speculum was placed.  The vitreoretinal team placed the infusion cannula after performing a peritomy.  At this point in the case, the patient was turned over to the cornea service with Mrs. Jun.  A paracentesis was made at the approximately 3 o'clock position.  Healon was placed into the anterior chamber.  The diamond keratome was used to make a vertical groove incision just inside the limbus at the 108-degree axis.  This incision was then shelved anteriorly and used to enter the anterior chamber.  The Utrata forceps were used to complete a continuous circular capsulorrhexis after incision of the capsule with the cystotome.  Hydrodissection was performed.  The lens nucleus was removed using phacoemulsification and irrigation and aspiration.  Lens cortex also was removed using irrigation and aspiration.  Viscoelastic was placed to inflate the capsular remnant.  The diamond knife was used to enlarge the phaco incision.  Intraocular lens was selected from preoperative calculations, placed in the injector system, and inserted into the capsule without difficulty.  The trailing haptic was placed using the Sheets forceps and the Barraquer sweep to push the IOL optic posteriorly as the trailing haptic was placed.  The anterior cornea wound was sutured along with the paracentesis after irrigation and aspiration was performed to remove remaining viscoelastic from the anterior chamber.  This was done without difficulty.  The anterior chamber was secured and watertight at the end of the procedure.  Intraocular pressure was satisfactory.

Here, the proposed scalp incision was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and then a zigzag scalp incision was made from one ear to the other ear, posterior to the coronal suture.  Scalp incision was reflected anteriorly and then the periosteum was taken off of the bone and then the temporalis muscles were reflected anterolaterally until the anterior cranial vault was exposed and then the periorbital rim, nasion and orbital part of the zygomatic arch were all dissected out as well as the pterion.  Using a craniotome, several bur holes were made; two on the either side of the midline posteriorly and then two posterolaterally.  The two posterior bur holes were then connected with a punch over the superior sagittal sinus and then the craniotome was used to fashion a flap first on the left and then on the right, going paramedian along the superior sagittal sinus in the midline and then curving over the fronto-orbital bar.  We then dissected superior sagittal sinus off of the inner table of the right bundle flap and then connected the right bundle flap going across the pterion on the right, which was abnormal.  The pterion on the right was then run short down after removing both bone flaps and then the dura was dissected off from the orbital roofs.  On the right, the orbital roof was jagged and abnormal and we had to repair a CSF leak from where the dura was punctured by the orbital roof.  The orbital rim was then dissected out and then using the saw and chisels, we were able to make the releasing cuts to free up the orbital rims, zygomatic arch and then remove the orbital bar going posteriorly and then the distal bar was split in the middle and then reapproximated with a bone graft in the middle to move the orbits out a little bit and the orbital bar was held together using absorbable plate.  It was then replaced and advanced and then relaxing, barrel-staving incisions were made in the bone flaps and the orbital rim and it was held on the right side with an absorbable plate to fix it in the proper position.  The bone flaps were then reapproximated using absorbable plates and screws, as well as #2-0 Vicryl to secure back into place.  Some of the places were also secured in the midline posteriorly, as well as off to the right where the bony defects were in place.  The periosteum was then brought over the skull and fastened in place and the temporalis muscles were tacked up to the periosteum.  The wounds were irrigated out.  A drain was left in posteriorly and then the wounds were closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the galea and fast-absorbing gut for the skin followed by sterile dressings.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and did receive blood transfusions.",Surgery

A C5-C7 anterior cervical plate fixation (Sofamor Danek titanium window plate) intraoperative fluoroscopy used and intraoperative microscopy used.  Intraoperative SSEP and EMG monitoring used.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: , This lady presented with history of cervical pain associated with cervical radiculopathy with cervical and left arm pain, numbness, weakness, with MRI showing significant disk protrusions with the associate complexes at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated cervical radiculopathy.  After failure of conservative treatment, this patient elected to undergo surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and after adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was placed supine on the OR table with the head of the bed about 10 degrees.  A shoulder roll was placed and the head supported on a donut support.  The cervical region was prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A transverse cervical incision was made from the midline, which was lateral to the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid two fingerbreadths above the right clavicle.  In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done.  Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly.  Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy.  Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly.  A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint.  On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect.  This was done under the microscope.  A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus.  A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level.  This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen.  Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released.  Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right.  This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots.  With this done, the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation.  Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites.  Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed.  A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7.  The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7.  With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down.  A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site.  Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.  Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling.  In addition, intraoperative SSEP, EMG monitoring, and motor-evoked potentials remained stable throughout the procedure.  The patient remained stable throughout the procedure.",Surgery

At baseline, he can put about 2 to 4 words together in brief sentences.  His speech is not always easily understood; however, he is in a special education classroom in kindergarten.  He ambulates independently, but falls often.  He has difficulty with his left side compared to the right, and prefers to use the right upper extremity more than the left.  Mother reports he postures the left upper extremity when running.  He is being followed by Medical Therapy Unit and has also been seen in the past by Dr. X.  He has not received Botox or any other interventions with regard to his cerebral palsy.,The patient did require one shunt revision, but since then his shunt has done well.,The patient developed seizures about 2 years ago.  These occurred periodically, but they are always in the same and with the involvement of the left side more than right and he had an eye deviation forcefully to the left side.  His events, however, always tend to be prolonged.  He has had seizures as long as an hour and a half.  He tends to require multiple medications to stop them.  He has been followed by Dr. Y and was started on Trileptal.  At one point, The patient was taken off his medication for presumed failure to prevent his seizures.  He was more recently placed on Topamax since March 2007.  His last seizures were in March and May respectively.  He is worked up to a dose of 25 mg capsules, 2 capsules twice a day or about 5 mg/kg/day at this point.,The patient was in his usual state of health until early this morning and was noted to be in seizure.  His seizure this morning was similar to the previous seizures with forced deviation of his head and eyes to the left side and convulsion more on the left side than the right.  Family administered Diastat 7.5 mg x1 dose.  They did not know they could repeat this dose.  EMS was called and he received lorazepam 2 mg and then in the emergency department, 15 mg/kg of fosphenytoin.  His seizures stopped thereafter, since that time, he had gradually become more alert and is eating, and is nearly back to baseline.  He is a bit off balance and tends to be a bit weaker on the left side compared to baseline postictally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , At this time, he is positive for a low-grade fever, he has had no signs of illness otherwise.  He does have some fevers after his prolonged seizures.  He denies any respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  There is no numbness or loss of skills.  He has no rashes, arthritis or arthralgias.

His speech is very dysarthric and he tends to run his words together.  He is about 50% understandable at best.  He does put words and sentences together.  His cranial nerves reveal his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  His extraocular movements are intact.  His visual fields are full.  Disks are sharp bilaterally.  His face shows left facial weakness postictally.  His palate elevates midline.  Vision is intact bilaterally.  Tongue protrudes midline.,Motor exam reveals clearly decreased strength on the left side at baseline.  His left thigh is abducted at the hip at rest with the right thigh and leg straight.  He has difficulty using the left arm and while reaching for objects, shows exaggerated tremor/dysmetria.  Right upper extremity is much more on target.  His sensations are intact to light touch bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.  When sitting up, he shows some truncal instability and tendency towards decreased truncal tone and kyphosis.  He also shows some scoliotic curve of the spine, which is mild at this point.  Gait was not tested today.,IMPRESSION: , This is a 6-year-old male with recurrent status epilepticus, left hemiparesis, history of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage.  He is on Topamax, which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg a day or 50 mg twice a day.  At this point, it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not, but the dose is clearly not at maximum, and he is tolerating the dose currently.  The plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning, and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks, and then 75 mg twice daily.  Reviewed the possible side effects of higher doses of Topamax, they will monitor him for language issues, cognitive problems or excessive somnolence.  I also discussed his imaging studies, which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other areas and despite this, the patient at baseline has a reasonable balance.  The plan from CT standpoint is to continue stretching program, continue with medical therapy unit.  He may benefit from Botox.,In addition, I reviewed the Diastat protocol with parents and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time, they can administer Diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minutes or even 5 minutes that they were waiting before.  They are going to repeat the dose within 10 minutes and they can call EMS at any point during that time.  Hopefully at home, they need to start to abort these seizures or the higher dose of Topamax will prevent them.  Other medication options would include Keppra, Zonegran or Lamictal.,FOLLOWUP: , Followup has already been scheduled with Dr. Y in February and they will continue to keep that date for followup.",Consult - History and Phy.

749,"PROCEDURE: , Left heart catheterization, left and right coronary angiography, left ventricular angiography, and intercoronary stenting of the right coronary artery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the Catheterization Laboratory.  After informed consent, he was medicated with Versed and fentanyl.  The right groin was prepped and draped, and infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine.  Percutaneously, #6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Selective native left and right coronary angiography was performed followed by left ventricular angiography.  The patient had a totally occluded right coronary.  We initially started with a JR4 guide.  We were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis.  We were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated.  We then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis, but we had very little guide support, the guide kept coming out.  We then switched to an AL1 guide and that too did not enable us to get anything to cross this lesion.  We finally had to go an AL2 guide, we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection.  That guided seated, we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis, and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip.  The surgeons were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open, but we were able to re-cross with a sport wire.  We then re-dilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support, we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm Vision stent, where the lesion was and post-dilated it to 18 atmospheres.  Routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded, whether this was from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis was unclear, but we were able to re-wire that area and get a 25 x12 Vision balloon and dilate the area and re-establish flow to the small segment.  We then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm Vision stent at 18 atmospheres.  Final angiography showed resolution of the dissection.  We could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent.  No perforation and excellent flow.  During the intervention, we did give a bolus and drip of Angiomax.  At the end of the procedure, we stopped the Angiomax and gave 600 mg of Plavix.  We did a right femoral angiogram; however, the Angio-Seal plug could not take, so we used manual pressure and a Femostop.  We transported the patient to his room in stable condition.,ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA:,  Left main coronary is normal.  Left anterior descending artery has a fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60% stenosis of the LAD before it bifurcates into diagonal.  The diagonal does appear to have about 50% osteal stenosis.  There is a lot of plaquing further down the diagonal, but good flow.  The rest of the LAD looked good pass the proximal 60% stenosis and after the diagonal branch.  Circumflex artery was nondominant vessel, consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel.  The first obtuse marginal had a long 50% narrowing and then the AV groove branch was free of any disease.  Some mild collaterals to the right were seen.  Right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary, just about 0.5 cm after its origin.  After we got a wire across the area of occlusion, we could see some thrombosis and a 99% stenosis just at the curve.  Following the balloon angioplasty, we established good flow down the distal vessel.  We still had about residual 70% stenosis.  When we had to go back with the AL2 guide, we could see a little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused a little bit of intimal dissection.  We re-dilated and then deployed.  Repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally.  We never did have the wire that far down, so this was probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus.  After deploying the stent, we had total resolution of the original lesion.  We then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch, which the remainder of the vessel was patent giving off a large PDA.  The posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in its mid portion.  We got a wire through and dilated this.  We then came back and put a second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent.  Repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection, a little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in a little subintimal pouch, but this was excluded by the stent.  There were no filling defects in the stent and excellent flow.  The distal posterolateral branch did open up, although it was little under-filled and there may have been some mild residual disease there.,IMPRESSION: , Atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary, successfully stented to zero residual with repair of a small proximal dissection.  Minor distal disease of the posterolateral branch and 60% proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50% diagonal stenosis along with 50% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch.",Surgery

2028,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left hip degenerative arthritis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left hip degenerative arthritis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Total hip arthroplasty on the left.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,BLOOD LOSS: , 800 cc.,The patient was positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag.,IMPLANT SPECIFICATION: , A 54 mm Trilogy cup with cluster holes 3 x 50 mm diameter with a appropriate liner, a 28 mm cobalt-chrome head with a zero neck length head, and a 12 mm porous proximal collared femoral component.,GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,Severe degenerative changes within the femoral head as well as the acetabulum, anterior as well as posterior osteophytes.  The patient also had a rent in the attachment of the hip abductors and a partial rent in the vastus lateralis.  This was revealed once we removed the trochanteric bursa.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 56-year-old obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis.  She underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by Dr. X in the year of 2000, and over the past three years, the symptoms in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few months.,Because of the increased amount of pain as well as severe effect on her activities of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication, the patient has elected to undergo the above-named procedure.  All risks as well complications were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection, scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, risk of anesthesia, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.  The patient understood all these risks and was willing to continue further on with the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to the Operating Room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/27/03.  The general anesthetic was first performed by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was then positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag in the lateral position.  Kidney rests were also used because of the patient's size.  An axillary roll was also inserted for comfort in addition to a Foley catheter, which was inserted by the OR nurse.  All her bony prominences were well padded.  At this time, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  At this time, an anterolateral approach was then performed, first incising through the skin in approximately 5 to 6 inches of subcutaneous fat.  The tensor fascia lata was then identified.  A self-retainer was then inserted to expose the operative field.  Bovie cautery was used for hemostasis.  At this time, a fresh blade was then used to incise the tensor fascia lata over the posterior one-third of the greater trochanter.  At this time, a blunt dissection was taken proximally.  The tensor fascia lata was occluded with a hip retractor.  At this time, after hemostasis was obtained, Bovie cautery was used to incise the proximal end of the vastus lateralis and removing the partial portion of the hip abductor, the gluteus medius.  At this time, a periosteal elevator was used to expose anterior hip capsule.  A ________ was then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle.  Once this was performed, Homan retractors were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck.  At this time, a capsulotomy was then performed using a Bovie cautery and the capsulotomy was ________ and then edged over the acetabulum.  At this point, a large bone hook was then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation, the femoral head was dislocated out of the acetabulum.  At this time, we had an exposure of the femoral head, which did reveal degenerative changes of the femoral head and once the acetabulum was visualized, we did see degenerative changes within the acetabulum as well as osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum.  At this time, a femoral stem guide was then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut.  We made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter.  At this time, with protection of the soft tissues an oscillating saw was used to make femoral neck cut.,The femoral head was then removed.  At this time, we removed the leg out of the bag and Homan retractors were then used to expose the acetabulum.  A long-handle knife was used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum.  With better exposure of the acetabulum, we started reaming the acetabulum.  We started with a size #44 and progressively reamed to a size #50.  At the size #50 mm reamer, we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly as well as superiorly within the acetabulum.  We then reamed up to size #52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim as well as anterior and posterior within the acetabulum.  A size 54 mm Trilogy cup was then implanted with excellent approaches approximately 45 degrees of abduction and 10 to 15 degrees of anteversion dialed in.  Once the cup was impacted in place, we did visualize that the cup was well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum.  At this time, two screws were the placed within the superior table for better approaches securing the acetabular cup.  At this time, a plastic liner was then inserted for protection.  The leg was then placed back in the bag.  A Bennett retractor was used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator was used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time, we began working on the femur.  A rongeur was used to lateralize over the greater trochanter.  A Box osteotome was used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck.  A Charnley awl was then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal.  A power reamer was then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem.  At this time, we began broaching.  We started with a size #10 and progressively worked up to a size #12 mm broach.  Once the 12 mm broach was inserted in place, it was seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar.  A calcar reamer was then placed and the calcar was reamed smoothly.  A standard neck as well as a 28 mm plastic head was then placed and a trial reduction was then performed.  Once this was performed, the hip was taken to range of motion with external rotation, longitudinal traction as well as flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation.  At this time, we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum.  This was impacted and placed and checked to assure that it was well seated with no loosening.  Once this was performed, we then exposed the proximal femur one more time.  We copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry.  At this time, a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem, a femoral component was then impacted in place.  Once it was well seated on the calcar, we double checked to assure that there was no evidence of calcar fractures, which there were none.  The 28 mm zero neck length cobalt-chrome femoral head was then impacted in place and the Morse taper assured that this was well fixed by ________.,Next, the hip was then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion as well as ligamentous stability with gentle traction, external rotation, as well as hip flexion.  We were satisfied with components as well as the alignment of the components.  Copious irrigation was then used to irrigate the wound.  #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule.  #1 Ethibond in interrupted fashion was used to approximate the vastus lateralis as well as the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which was resected off the greater trochanter.  Next, a #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figure-of-eight closure.  A tight closure was performed.  Since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat, multiple #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to approximate the bed space and then #2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Staples were then used for skin closure.  The patient's hip was then cleansed.  Sterile dressings consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, ABDs, and foam tape were then placed.  A drain was placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage.  After the dressing was applied, the patient was extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good.",Orthopedic

1281,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:,  Strokes.,SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPY DIAGNOSIS:  ,Global aphasia.,SUBJECTIVE:  ,The patient is a 44-year-old female who is referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy, status post stroke.  The patient's sister-in-law was present throughout this assessment and provided all the patient's previous medical history.  Based on the sister-in-law's report, the patient had a stroke on 09/19/08.  The patient spent 6 weeks at XY Medical Center, where she was subsequently transferred to XYZ for therapy for approximately 3 weeks.  ABCD brought the patient to home the Monday before Thanksgiving, because they were not satisfied with the care the patient was receiving at a skilled nursing facility in Tucson.  The patient's previous medical history includes a long history of illegal drug use to include cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and marijuana.  In March of 2008, the patient had some type of potassium issue and she was hospitalized at that time.  Prior to the stroke, the patient was not working and ABCD reported that she believes the patient completed the ninth grade, but she did not graduate from high school.  During the case history, I did pose several questions to the patient, but her response was often ""no.""  She was very emotional during this evaluation and crying occurred multiple times.,OBJECTIVE:  ,To evaluate the patient's overall communication ability, a Western Aphasia Battery was completed.  Also tests were not done due to time constraint and the patient's severe difficulty and emotional state.  Speech automatic tests were also completed to determine if the patient had any functional speech.,ASSESSMENT:,  Based on the results of the Weston aphasia battery, the patient's deficits most closely resemble global aphasia.  On the spontaneous speech subtest, the patient responded ""no"" to all questions asked except for how are you today where she gave a thumbs-up.  She provided no responses to picture description task and it is unclear if the patient was unable to follow the direction or if she was unable to see the picture clearly.  The patient's sister-in-law did state that the patient wore glasses, but she currently does not have them and she did not know the extent the patient's visual deficit.,On the auditory verbal comprehension portion of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient answered ""no"" to all ""yes/no"" questions.  The auditory word recognition subtest, the patient had 5 out of 60 responses correct.  With the sequential command, she had 10 out of 80 corrects.  She was able to shut her eyes, point to the window, and point to the pen after directions.  With repetition subtest, she repeated bed correctly, but no other stimuli.  At this time, the patient became very emotional and repeatedly stated ""I can't"".  During the naming subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient's responses contained numerous paraphasias and her speech was often unintelligible due to jargon.  The word fluency test was not administered and the patient scored 2 out of 10 on the sentence completion task and 0 out of 10 on the responsive speech.  In regards to speech automatics, the patient is able to count from 1 to 9 accurately; however, stated 7 instead of 10 at the end of the task.  She is not able to state the days of the week or months in the year or her name at this time.  She cannot identify the day on calendar and was unable to verbally state the date or month.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient's communication deficits most closely resemble global aphasia where she has difficulty with both receptive as well as expressive communication.  She does perseverate and is very emotional due to probable frustration.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended to improve the patient's functional communication skills.,PATIENT GOAL: , Her sister-in-law stated that they would like to improve upon the patient's speech to allow her to communicate more easily at home.,PLAN OF CARE: , Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for the next 12 weeks.  Therapy to include aphasia treatment and home activities.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):,1.  The patient will answer simple ""yes/no"" questions with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.,2.  The patient will be able to complete speech automatic tasks with greater than 80% accuracy without models or cueing.,3.

Since then, the patient started complaining of acute right arm and right leg weakness, which had been progressively worsening.  About two days ago, he started noticing weakness on the left arm.  The patient also noted shuffling gait.  The patient presented to a family physician and was referred to Dr. X for further evaluation.  Dr. X could not attempt to this, so he called me at the office and the patient was sent to the emergency room, where an MRI of the brain was essentially unremarkable as well as MRI of the thoracic spine.  MRI of the cervical spine, however, revealed an acute disk herniation at C3-C4 with evidence of stenosis and cord changes.  Based on these findings, I recommended decompression.  The patient was started on Decadron at 10 mg IV q.6h.  Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with him.  Risks to include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Bleeding can be superficial, but can compromise airway, for which he has been told that he may be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  The hematoma could also be an epidural hematoma, which may compress the spinal cord and result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function.  Should this happen, he needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the risk by removing the hematoma that he can deteriorate as far as neurological condition, but this hopefully with the steroid prep will be prevented or if present will only be transient.  There is also the possibility of infection, which can be superficial and treated with IV and p.o. antibiotics.  However, should the infection be extensive or be deep, he may require return to the operating room for debridement and irrigation.  This may pose a medical problem since in the presence of infection, the graft as well as spinal instrumentation may have to be removed.  There is also the possibility of dural tear with its attendant complaints of headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, as well as the development of pseudomeningocele.  This too can compromise airway and may require return to the operating room for repair of the dural tear.  There is also potential risk of injury to the esophagus, the trachea, as well as the carotid.  The patient can also have a stroke on the right cerebral circulation should the plaque be propelled into the right circulation.  The patient understood all these risks together with the risk associated with anesthesia and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert and not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  No monitoring leads were placed.  The patient was then positioned supine on the operating table with the head supported on a foam doughnut and the neck placed on hyperextension with a shoulder roll under both shoulders.  Localizing x-ray verified the marker to be right at the C3-4 interspace.  Proceeded to mark an incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid with the central point at the area of the marker measuring about 3 cm in length.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to cut the platysma in a similar fashion.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was identified and dissection was carried superior to and lateral to the esophagus and trachea, but medial to the carotid sheath.  The prevertebral fascia was identified.  Localizing x-ray verified another marker to be at the C3-4 interspace.  Proceeded to strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C3 and C4 and a self-retaining retractor was then laid out.  There was some degree of anterior osteophyte and this was carefully drilled down with a Midas 5-mm bur.  The disk was then cut through the annulus and removal of the disk was done with the use of the Midas 5-mm bur and later a 3-mm bur.  The inferior endplate of C3 and the superior endplate of C4 were likewise drilled out together with posterior inferior osteophyte at the C3 and the posterior superior osteophyte at C4.  There was note of a central disk herniation centrally, but more marked displacement of the cord on the left side.  By careful dissection of this disk, posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and pressure on the cord was removed.  Hemostasis of the epidural bleeders was done with a combination of bipolar coagulation, but we needed to put a small piece of Gelfoam on the patient's left because of profuse venous bleeder.  With this completed, the Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  A 7-mm implant with its interior packed with Vitoss was then tapped into place.  An 18-mm plate was then screwed down with four 14 x 4.0 mm screws.  The area was irrigated with saline, with bacitracin solution.  Postoperative x-ray showed excellent placement of the graft and spinal instrumentation.  A round French 10 JP drain was laid over the construct and exteriorized though a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures for the platysma, Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis and Dermabond.  The catheter was anchored to the skin with a nylon 3-0 stitch.  Dressing was placed only on the exit site of the drain.  C-collar was placed, and the patient was transferred to the recovery awake and moving all four extremities.",Surgery

Facial rhytides.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Same.,PROCEDURE: , Temporal cheek-neck facelift (CPT 15825).  Submental suction assisted lipectomy (CPT 15876).,ANESTHESIA: , General.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , This patient is a 65-year-old female who has progressive aging changes of the face and neck.  The patient demonstrates the deformities described above and has requested surgical correction.  The procedure, risks, limitations, and alternatives in this individual case have been very carefully discussed with the patient.  The patient has consented to surgery.,The patient was brought into the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  An intravenous line was started and anesthesia was maintained throughout the case.  The patient was monitored for cardiac, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation continuously.,The hair was prepared and secured with rubber bands and micropore tape along the incision line.  A marking pen had been used to outline the area of the incisions, which included the preauricular area to the level of the tragus, the post-tragal region, the post auricular region and into the hairline.  In addition, the incision was marked in the temporal area in the event of a temporal lift, then across the coronal scalp for the forehead lift.  The incision was marked in the submental crease for the submental lipectomy and liposuction.  The incision in the post auricular area extended up on the posterior aspect of the ear and ended near the occipital hairline.,The areas to be operated on were injected with 1% Lidocaine containing 1:100,000 Epinephrine.  This provided local anesthesia and vasoconstriction.  The total of Lidocaine used throughout the procedure was maintained at no more than 500mg.,SUBMENTAL SUCTION ASSISTED LIPECTOMY: , The incision was made, as previously outlined, in the submental crease in a transverse direction, through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A Metzenbaum scissors was used to elevate the area in the submental region for about 2 or 3cm and making radial tunnels from the angle of the mandible all the way to the next angle of the mandible.  4mm liopsuction cannula was then introduced along these previously outlined tunnels into the jowl on both sides and down top the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid laterally and just past the thyroid notch interiorly.  The tunnels were enlarged with a 6mm flat liposuction cannula.,Then with the Wells-Johnson liposuction machine 27-29 inches of underwater mercury suction was accomplished in all tunnels.  Care was taken not to turn the opening of the suction cannula up to the dermis, but it was rotated in and out taking a symmetrical amount of fat from each area.  A similar procedure was performed with the 4 mm cannula cleaning the area.  Bilateral areas were palpated for symmetry, and any remaining fat was then suctioned directly.,A triangular wedge of anterior platysma border was cauterized and excised at the cervical mental angle.  A plication stitch of 3-0 Vicryl was placed.,When a satisfactory visible result had been accomplished from the liposuction, the inferior flap was then advanced over anteriorly and the overlying skin excised in an incremental fashion.  5-0 plain catgut was used for closure in a running interlocking fashion.  The wound was cleaned at the end, dried, and Mastisol applied.  Then tan micropore tape was placed for support to the entire area.,FACE LIFT: , After waiting approximately 10-15 minutes for adequate vasoconstriction the post auricular incision was started at the earlobe and continued up on the posterior aspect of the ear for approximately 2cm just superior to the external auditory canal.  A gentle curve was then made, and again the incision was carried down to and into the posterior hairline paralleling the hair follicles and directed posteriorly towards the occipital region.  A preauricular incision was carried into the natural crease superior to the tragus, curved posterior to the tragus bilaterally then brought out inferiorly in the natural crease between the lobule and preauricular skin.  The incision was made in the temporal area beveling parallel with the hair follicles.  (The incision had been designed with curve underneath the sideburn in order to maintain the sideburn hair locations and then curved posteriorly.),The plane of dissection in the hairbearing area was kept deep to the roots of the hair follicles and superficial to the fascia of the temporalis muscle and sternocleidomastoid.  The dissection over the temporalis muscle was continued anteriorly towards the anterior hairline and underneath the frontalis to the supraorbital rim.  At the superior level of the zygoma and at the level of the sideburn, dissection was brought more superficially in order to avoid the nerves and vessels in the areas, specifically the frontalis branch of the facial nerve.,The facial flaps were then elevated with both blunt and sharp dissection with the Kahn facelift dissecting scissors in the post auricular region to pass the angle of the mandible.  This area of undermining was connected with an area of undermining starting with the temporal region extending in the preauricular area of the cheek out to the jowl.  Great care was taken to direct the plane of dissecting superficial to the parotid fascia or SMAS.  The entire dissection was carried in a radial fashion from the ear for approximately 4cm at the lateral canthal area to 8-10cm in the neck region.  When the areas of dissection had been connected carefully, hemostasis was obtained and all areas inspected.  At no point were muscle fibers or major vessels or nerves encountered in the dissection.,The SMAS was sharply incised in a semilunar fashion in front of the ear and in front of the anterior border of the SCM.  The SMAS flap was then advanced posteriorly and superiorly.  The SMAS was split at the level of the earlobe, and the inferior portion was sutured to the mastoid periosteum.  The excess SMAS was trimmed and excised from the portion anterior to the auricle.  The SMAS was then imbricated with 2-0 Surgidak interrupted sutures.,The area was then inspected for any bleeding points and careful hemostasis obtained.  The flaps were then rotated and advanced posteriorly and then superiorly, and incremental cuts were made and the suspension points in the pre and post auricular area were done with 2-0 Tycron suture.  The excess and redundant amount of skin were then excised and trimmed cautiously so as not to cause any downward pull on the ear lobule or any stretching of the scars in the healing period.  Skin closure was accomplished in the hairbearing areas with 5-0 Nylon in the preauricular tuft and 4-0 Nylon interrupted in the post auricular area.  The pre auricular area was closed first with 5-0 Dexon at the ear lobules, and 6-0 Nylon at the lobules, and 5-0 plain catgut in a running interlocking fashion.  5-0 Plain catgut was used in the post auricular area as well, leaving ample room for serosanguinous drainage into the dressing.  The post tragal incisin was closed with interrupted and running interlocking 5-0 plain catgut.  The exact similar procedure was repeated on the left side.,At the end of this procedure, all flaps were inspected for adequate capillary filling or any evidence of hematoma formation.  Any small amount of fluid was expressed post-auricularly.  A fully perforated bulb suction drain was placed under the flap and exited posterior to the hairline on each side prior to the suture closure.  A Bacitracin impregnated nonstick dressing was cut to conform to the pre and post auricular area and placed over the incision lines.,ABD padding over 4X4 gauze was used to cover the pre and post auricular areas.  This was wrapped around the head in a vertical circumferential fashion and anchored with white micropore tape in a non-constricting but secured fashion.  The entire dressing complex was secured with a pre-formed elastic stretch wrap device.  All branches of the facial nerve were checked and appeared to be functioning normally.,The procedures were completed without complication and tolerated well.  The patient left the operating room in satisfactory condition.  A follow-up appointment was scheduled, routine post-op medications prescribed, and post-op instructions given to the responsible party.,The patient was released to home in satisfactory condition.",Cosmetic / Plastic Surgery

He reported to the Hospital the day after his altercation complaining of mall occlusion and sore left shoulder.  He was worked up by the emergency department.  His head CT was cleared and his left shoulder was clear of any fractures or soft tissue damage.  Oral maxillary facial surgery was consulted to manage the mandible fracture.  After review of the CT and examination it was determined that the patient would benefit from open reduction, internal fixation of bilateral mandible fractures.  Risks, benefits, and alternative to treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was brought to the operating room #2 at Hospital.  He was laid in supine position on the operating room table.  ASA monitors were attached and stated general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetic and maintained with nasal endotracheal intubation and inflation anesthetics.,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual oral maxillofacial surgery fashion.  The surgeon approached the operating room table in a sterile fashion.  Approximately 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into oral vestibule in a nerve block fashion.  Erich arch bars were adapted to the maxilla and mandible, secured in the posterior teeth with 24-gauge surgical steel wire and 26-gauge surgical steel wire in the anterior.  This was done from second molar to second molar on both the maxilla and the mandible secondary to the patient missing multiple teeth.  The patient was manipulated up into maximum intercuspation.  He has a malocclusion with severe bruxism and so wear facets were lined up.  This was secured with 26-gauge surgical steel wire.  Attention was then directed to the symphysis extraorally.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was injected into the area of incision which paralleled the inferior border of the mandible 2 cm below the inferior border of the mandible.,After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia using a 15 blade, a skin and platysma incision was made.  Then using a series of blunt and sharp dissections, the dissection was carried to the inferior border of the mandible.  The periosteum was incised and reflected with the periosteal elevator.  The fracture was noted and it was displaced.  Manipulation of the segments and checking with the occlusion intraorally, the fracture was aligned.  This was secured with 7-hole 2.3 titanium locking reconstruction plate with bicortical screws.  The wound was then packed with moist Ray-Tec and attention was directed intraorally to the left angle fracture.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the left vestibule.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take effect, using Bovie electrocautery, a sagittal split incision was made and the fracture was identified.  It was noted that the fracture went through tooth #17 and this needed to be extracted.  Taking a round bur, a buckle trough was made and the tooth was elevated and removed both distal and mesial roots.  The fracture was then reduced and lateral superior border plate 2-0 4 whole with monocortical screws was placed.  The fracture was noted to be well reduced.  The wound was then irrigated with copious amount of sterile water.  The patient was released for excellent intercuspation.  He was then manipulated up into the occlusion easily.  Wound was then closed with running 3-0 chromic gut suture.  Attention was then directed extraorally.  This was irrigated with copious amount of sterile water and closed in a layer fashion with 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and 5-0 Prolene on skin.  Attention was then again directed into the mouth.  The throat pack was removed and orogastric tube was placed and stomach content was evacuated.  The patient was then manipulated back up to maximum intercuspation and secured with interdental elastics and a pressure dressing was applied to the extraoral incisions.  At this point, the procedure was then determined to be over.,The patient was extubated and breathing spontaneously, transported to the PACU in excellent condition.",Dentistry

2905,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Recurrent dizziness x1 month.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems including CHF (O2 dependent), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, possible stroke, multiple joint disease including gout, arthritis, both rheumatoid and DJD, who presents with a complaint of one month of dizziness.  She reports a rotational sensation upon arising from the bed or chair that lasts for several minutes and requires her to sit back down and stay in one place.  She gets similar symptoms when she rolls over in bed.  She is not able to describe what direction she feels like she is spinning.  At times, she also feels as though she is going to pass out.  These sensations stop if she just sits in one place or lies down for several minutes.  She does note that it is worse when she turns to the right and when she turns to the left.  She also complains that she gets similar sensations when she looks up.  She denies any recent fever, chills, earache, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, other change in vision, or recent new headaches.  She also notes occasional tinnitus to her right ear.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  CHF (uses portable oxygen).,2.  Atrial fibrillation.,3.  Gout.,4.  Arthritis (DJD/rheumatoid).,5.

Tinnitus in the right ear.  Diabetes and hypothyroidism.  Chronic nausea.  Chronic severe musculoskeletal pains to all extremities as well as to chest and abdomen and back.  Right-sided numbness as well as complaints of bilateral lower extremity numbness and difficulty walking.  She says her mood is sad and may be depressed and she is also extremely anxious.  She has chronic shortness of breath and coughs easily when has to breathe deeply.  She also endorses poor sleep.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Sitting BP 112/84 with a pulse of 84, standing after two minutes 130/90 with a pulse of 66.  Respiratory rate is 20.  Weight is 257 pounds.  Pain scale is 7.,GENERAL:  This is a somewhat anxious elderly African-American female who tends to amplify findings on examination.  It is a difficult examination due to the fact that no matter where the patient was touched she would wince in pain and withdraw.  She is obese.,HEENT:  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear.  Tympanic membranes were visualized bilaterally.  There is tenderness to palpation of any sinus region.  There are no palpable cervical nodes.,NECK:  Supple although she complains of pain when rotating her neck.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.,HEART:  Heart sounds are distant.  There are no carotid bruits.,EXTREMITIES:  She has 1-2+ pitting edema to the mid shins bilaterally.,NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:,MENTAL STATUS:  She is alert and oriented x3.  Her speech is fluent; however, she is extremely tangential.  She is unable to give a cogent medical history including details of hospitalization one month ago when she was admitted for a gout attack and urinary tract infection and underwent several days of rehabilitation.,CRANIAL NERVES:  Cranial nerves are intact throughout; specifically there is no nystagmus, her gaze is conjugate, there is no diplopia, visual fields are full to confrontation, pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements are intact, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, vestibuloocular reflexes are intact, hearing is intact to finger rub bilaterally, palate rises symmetrically, normal cough, shoulder shrug is symmetric which shows easy breakaway give, and tongue protrudes in the midline.,MOTOR:  This is a limited exam due to easy breakaway gait and pain that appears exaggerated to movement of any extremity.  There is suggestion of some mild right-sided paresis; however, the degree was inconsistent and her phasic strength is estimated at 4-4+ throughout.  Her tone is normal throughout.,SENSORY:  She appears to have diffuse light tough and pinprick and temperature to the right arm and proximal leg.  She also reports that she is numb in both feet; however, sensation testing of light tough, pinprick and vibration was intact.,COORDINATION:  There is no obvious dysmetria.,GAIT:  She uses a walker to stand up, and several near falls when asked to stand unassisted and can only ambulate with a walker.  There are some mild right lower extremity circumduction present.,REFLEXES:  Biceps 1, triceps trace, brachioradialis 1, patella and ankle absent.  Toes are equivocal.,OTHER:  Barany maneuver was attempted; however, when the patient was placed supine she immediately began screaming, ""Oh my back, oh my back"", and was unable to complete the maneuver.  Brief inspection of her eyes failed to show any nystagmus at that time.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems who presents with episodic positionally related dizziness of unclear etiology.  Most certainly there is significant exaggeration of the underlying problem and her neurological examination is compounded by much functional overlay, limiting the interpretation of my findings.  I suspect this is just a mild benign positional vertigo, although I cannot rule out vertebrobasilar compromise.  I agree with symptomatic treatment with Antivert.,We will schedule her for CT of head, CT angiogram to evaluate for possible brain stroke and vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  In addition, we will attempt to get further objective data by ENG testing.  I will see the patient again after these tests are completed and she has a trial of the Antivert.",Neurology

This patient had approximately greater than ten years of chronic pelvic pain with dysmenorrhea which has significantly affected her activities of daily living.  Symptoms have not improved with prescription of oral contraceptives.,The patient has had one prior surgery for a left ovarian cystectomy done by laparoscopy in 1996.  The cyst was not diagnosed as an endometrioma.  The patient does desire future fertility; however, would like a definitive diagnosis.  Conservative medical therapy was offered i.e.  Lupron or repeat oral contraceptives, but declined.,FINDINGS:,  Bimanual exam reveals a small retroverted uterus which is easily mobile.  There were no adnexal masses.  The cervix was normal on palpation.  A fibrotic band was noted at the internal os during dilation.  On laparoscopic exam, the uterus was found to be small with mild spongy texture.  On palpation, the right ovary and adnexa were grossly normal with no evidence of endometriosis.  The left ovary was grossly normal.  The left fallopian tube had a mild hydrosalpinx present.  The left uterosacral ligament had three to four 1 mm to 2 mm lesions that were vesicular in nature consistent with endometriosis.  The vesicouterine reflection in the anterior aspect of the uterus were within normal limits as were the posterior cul-de-sac.  The liver appeared grossly normal.  There were no obvious pelvic adhesions.  The left internal inguinal ring is somewhat patent, however, there is no bowel or viscera protruding through it.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was seen in the preop suite.  History was reviewed and all questions were answered.  The patient was then taken to the operative suite where she was placed under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube.  She was placed in a dorsal lithotomy position in Allen stirrups.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter producing approximately 100 cc of clear yellow urine.  A bimanual exam was performed by Dr. X, Dr. Y, and Dr. Z with above findings noted.  A sterile weighted speculum was placed in posterior aspect of the vagina and the anterior aspect of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  There was an attempt to place the uterine sound through the external and internal cervical os, however, secondary to a fibrotic band at the internal os that was impossible.  A #9 dilator was allowed to remain in the cervix for minimal manipulation while attention was then turned to the abdomen.  An infraumbilical incision was made using skin scalpel.  The Veress needle was placed and CO2 was insufflated.  It was immediately noticed that the pressures were inconsistent with intraabdominal insufflation and the CO2 was discontinued and Veress needle was completely removed.  A second attempt placement of the Veress needle into the abdomen was successful and CO2 was insufflated approximately 3 liters with minimal intraabdominal pressure.  The #12 port was placed and the laparoscope was inserted.  Attention was then turned back to the uterus and with the assistance of current hemostat to bluntly dissect the fibrotic band of the internal os.,Successful sounding of the uterus showed an 8-cm uterus that was in a retroverted position.  The cervix was serially dilated using Hank dilators to allow for introduction of the sharp curette.  A curettage was then performed and specimen of the endometrium was sent for pathologic evaluation.  This procedure was performed under direct laparoscopic visualization.  Laparoscopic evaluation of the pelvis was performed and the above findings noted.  A second abdominal incision was performed suprapubically using a skin scalpel and the Veress needle was placed through the incision successfully under direct visualization.  A #5 port was then placed through the sheath and the uterine manipulator was used to complete visualization.  The manipulator was then removed and the Harmonic scalpel was placed through the #5 port.  The Harmonic scalpel was used then to ablate the 1 mm vesicular lesions on the left uterosacral ligament.  The lesions were suspect for endometriosis, however, they were not diagnostic of endometriosis.  There was also present a 3 mm to 5 mm submucosal uterine fibroid on the right lower uterine segment.  The Harmonic scalpel was removed from the abdomen as was the #5 port.  The incision was internally found to be hemostatic.  The laparoscope was then removed from the abdomen.  The abdomen was desufflated.  The introducer was then replaced into the #12 port and the #12 port was removed from the abdomen.  The uterine manipulator was removed from the uterus and the cervix was found to be hemostatic.  The weighted speculum was then removed.  The patient taken out of dorsal lithotomy position.  She was recovered from general anesthesia and taken to the postoperative suite for complete recovery.  The patient's discharge instructions will include a followup in one to two weeks in Dr. X's office for discussion of pathology.  Her family was notified of the findings.  She will be instructed not to have intercourse or use tampons or douche for the next two weeks.  The patient will be sent home with a prescription for Darvocet for pain.",Surgery

Steroid injection, stenosing tenosynovitis of right middle finger.,ANESTHESIA:  ,Monitored anesthesia care with regional anesthesia applied by surgeon.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , Left upper extremity was 15 minutes.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  With the patient under adequate monitored anesthesia, the left upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mmHg.  Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray.  A transverse incision was made in the palm between FCR and FCU, one finger breadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.,Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the Hood of Hamate.  The Agee Inside Job was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.  The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the Agee Inside Job was withdrawn, dividing transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division of transverse carpal ligament, the Agee Inside Job was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified and complete release was accomplished.  One mL of Celestone was then introduced into the carpal tunnel and irrigated free.  ,The wound was then closed with a running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.  Steri-strips were applied and a sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-strips.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Attention was turned to the right palm where after a sterile prep, the right middle finger flexor sheath was injected with 0.5 mL of 1% plain Xylocaine and 0.5 mL of Depo-Medrol 40 mg/mL.

192,"DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  Local anesthesia was obtained with a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% bupivacaine given as a peribulbar block.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.,A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Calipers were set at 3.5 mm and a mark was made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.,A 5-0 nylon suture was passed through partial-thickness sclera on either side of this mark.  The MVR blade was used to make a sclerotomy between the pre-placed sutures.  An 8-0 nylon suture was then pre-placed for later sclerotomy closure.  The infusion cannula was inspected and found to be in good working order.  The infusion cannula was placed in the vitreous cavity and secured with the pre-placed sutures.  The tip of the infusion cannula was directly visualized and found to be free of any overlying tissue and the infusion was turned on.,Additional sclerotomies were made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the supranasal and supratemporal quadrants.  The light pipe and vitrectomy handpieces were then placed in the vitreous cavity and a vitrectomy was performed.  There was moderately severe vitreous hemorrhage, which was removed.  Once a view of the posterior pole could be obtained, there were some diabetic membranes emanating along the arcades.  These were dissected with curved scissors and judicious use of the vitrectomy cutter.  There was some bleeding from the inferotemporal frond.  This was managed by raising the intraocular pressure and using intraocular cautery.  The surgical view became cloudy and the corneal epithelium was removed with a beaver blade.  This improved the view.  There is an area suspicious for retinal break near where the severe traction was inferotemporally.  The Endo laser was used to treat in a panretinal scatter fashion to areas that had not received previous treatment.  The indirect ophthalmoscope was used to examine the retinal peripheral for 360 degrees and no tears, holes or dialyses were seen.  There was some residual hemorrhagic vitreous skirt seen.  The soft-tip cannula was then used to perform an air-fluid exchange.  Additional laser was placed around the suspicious area inferotemporally.  The sclerotomies were then closed with 8-0 nylon suture in an X-fashion, the infusion cannula was removed and it sclerotomy closed with the pre-existing 8-0 nylon suture.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut.  A subconjunctival injection of Ancef and Decadron were given and a drop of atropine was instilled over the eye.  The lid speculum was removed.  Maxitrol ointment was instilled over the eye and the eye was patched.  The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable condition.",Surgery

She admits to some nausea associated with it.  There have been no fevers, chills, and/or genitourinary symptoms.  The patient had right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant.  She had a leukocytosis of 12.8.  She did undergo a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which was non diagnostic for an acute appendicitis.  Given the severity of her abdominal examination and her persistence of her symptoms, we recommend the patient undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with probable need for laparoscopic appendectomy and possible open appendectomy.  The risks, benefits, complications of the procedure, she gave us informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,Exploration of the abdomen via laparoscopy revealed an appendix with suppurative fluid surrounding it, it was slightly enlarged.  The left ovary revealed some follicular cysts.  There was no evidence of adnexal masses and/or torsion of the fallopian tubes.  The uterus revealed no evidence of mass and/or fibroid tumors.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operative suite, placed in the supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient underwent general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient also received a preoperative dose of Ancef 1 gram IV.  After adequate sedation was achieved, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make an infraumbilical transverse incision utilizing a Veress needle.  Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen and the abdomen was insufflated approximately 15 mmHg.  Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a 10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  A video laparoscope was inserted into the infraumbilical trocar site and the abdomen was explored.  Next, a 5 mm port was inserted in the midclavicular line of the right upper quadrant region.  This was inserted under direct visualization.  Finally, a suprapubic 12 mm portal was created.  This was performed with #10 blade scalpel to create a transverse incision.  A bladed trocar was inserted into the suprapubic region.  This was done again under direct visualization.  Maryland dissector was inserted into the suprapubic region and a window was created between the appendix and mesoappendix at the base of the cecum.  This was done while the 5 mm trocar was used to grasp the middle portion of the appendix and retracted anteriorly.  Utilizing a endovascular stapling device, the appendix was transected and doubly stapled with this device.  Next, the mesoappendix was doubly stapled and transected with the endovascular stapling device.  The staple line was visualized and there was no evidence of bleeding.  The abdomen was fully irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  The abdomen was then aspirated.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  All ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding from the port sites.  The infraumbilical and suprapubic ports were then closed.  The fascias were then closed with #0-Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle.  Once the fascias were closed, all incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The areas were cleaned, Steri-Strips were placed across the wound.  Sterile dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was extubated following the procedure, returned to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  She will be admitted to General Medical Floor and she will be followed closely in the early postoperative course.",Gastroenterology

After excision of neoplasm, there was a separate 1 x 2 cm nodule palpated within the cavity.  This too was excised.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position in the operating table.  Intravenous sedation was administered by the Anesthesia Department.  The Kopans wire was trimmed to an appropriate length.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  Local anesthetic consisting of 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the proposed line of incision.  A curvilinear circumareolar incision was then made with a #15 scalpel blade close to the wire.  The wire was stabilized and brought to protrude through the incision.  Skin flaps were then generated with electrocautery.  A generous core tissue was grasped with Allis forceps and excised with electrocautery.  Prior to complete excision, the superior margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut short.  The lateral margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut along.  The posterior margin was marked with a #2-0 Polydek suture, which was tied and cut.,The specimen was then completely excised and sent off the operative field as specimen where specimen mammography confirmed the excision of the mammographically detected neoplasm.  On palpation of the cavity, there was felt to be a second nodule further medial and this was grasped with an Allis forceps and excised with electrocautery and sent off the field as a separate specimen.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  The incision was closed in two layers.  The first layer consisting of a subcuticular inverted interrupted sutures of #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The second layer consisted of Steri-Strips on the epidermis.

The patient underwent a Bier block by the Department of Anesthesia on the upper extremity.  The upper extremity was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and left free.  Attention was drawn then to the palm of the hand.  We did identify area of incision that we would make, which was located over the carpal tunnel.,Approximately, 1.5 cm incision was made using a #10 blade scalpel.  Dissection was carried through the skin and fascia over the palm down to the carpal tunnel taking care during dissection to avoid any branches of nerves.  Carpal tunnel was then entered and the rest of the transverse carpal ligament was incised sharply with a #10 scalpel.  We inspected the median nerve and found that it was flat and compressed from the transverse carpal ligament.  We found no evidence of tumor or space occupying lesion in the carpal tunnel.  We then irrigated copiously.  Tourniquet was taken down at that time and pressure was held.  There was no evidence of obvious bleeders.  We approximated the skin with nylon and placed a postoperative dressing with a volar splint.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was placed back in the gurney and taken to PACU.",Surgery

He reported to the Hospital the day after his altercation complaining of mall occlusion and sore left shoulder.  He was worked up by the emergency department.  His head CT was cleared and his left shoulder was clear of any fractures or soft tissue damage.  Oral maxillary facial surgery was consulted to manage the mandible fracture.  After review of the CT and examination it was determined that the patient would benefit from open reduction, internal fixation of bilateral mandible fractures.  Risks, benefits, and alternative to treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was brought to the operating room #2 at Hospital.  He was laid in supine position on the operating room table.  ASA monitors were attached and stated general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetic and maintained with nasal endotracheal intubation and inflation anesthetics.,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual oral maxillofacial surgery fashion.  The surgeon approached the operating room table in a sterile fashion.  Approximately 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into oral vestibule in a nerve block fashion.  Erich arch bars were adapted to the maxilla and mandible, secured in the posterior teeth with 24-gauge surgical steel wire and 26-gauge surgical steel wire in the anterior.  This was done from second molar to second molar on both the maxilla and the mandible secondary to the patient missing multiple teeth.  The patient was manipulated up into maximum intercuspation.  He has a malocclusion with severe bruxism and so wear facets were lined up.  This was secured with 26-gauge surgical steel wire.  Attention was then directed to the symphysis extraorally.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was injected into the area of incision which paralleled the inferior border of the mandible 2 cm below the inferior border of the mandible.,After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia using a 15 blade, a skin and platysma incision was made.  Then using a series of blunt and sharp dissections, the dissection was carried to the inferior border of the mandible.  The periosteum was incised and reflected with the periosteal elevator.  The fracture was noted and it was displaced.  Manipulation of the segments and checking with the occlusion intraorally, the fracture was aligned.  This was secured with 7-hole 2.3 titanium locking reconstruction plate with bicortical screws.  The wound was then packed with moist Ray-Tec and attention was directed intraorally to the left angle fracture.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the left vestibule.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take effect, using Bovie electrocautery, a sagittal split incision was made and the fracture was identified.  It was noted that the fracture went through tooth #17 and this needed to be extracted.  Taking a round bur, a buckle trough was made and the tooth was elevated and removed both distal and mesial roots.  The fracture was then reduced and lateral superior border plate 2-0 4 whole with monocortical screws was placed.  The fracture was noted to be well reduced.  The wound was then irrigated with copious amount of sterile water.  The patient was released for excellent intercuspation.  He was then manipulated up into the occlusion easily.  Wound was then closed with running 3-0 chromic gut suture.  Attention was then directed extraorally.  This was irrigated with copious amount of sterile water and closed in a layer fashion with 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and 5-0 Prolene on skin.  Attention was then again directed into the mouth.  The throat pack was removed and orogastric tube was placed and stomach content was evacuated.  The patient was then manipulated back up to maximum intercuspation and secured with interdental elastics and a pressure dressing was applied to the extraoral incisions.  At this point, the procedure was then determined to be over.,The patient was extubated and breathing spontaneously, transported to the PACU in excellent condition.",Surgery

Right suboccipital craniectomy and excision of tumor.,4.  Microtechniques for all the above.,5.  Stealth stereotactic guidance for all of the above and intraoperative ultrasound.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer made five years ago.  A year ago, she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation.  She recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office, unable to ambulate in a wheelchair.  Metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases, but no spinal cord compression.  She had a consult with Radiation-Oncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery, but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed.  Consequently, this operation is performed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient underwent a planning MRI scan with Stealth protocol.  She was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp.  General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  She was placed on the Mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position.  She was well padded, secured, and so forth.  The neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions.  The posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak scrub followed by Betadine paint.  This was done only, of course, after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the Stealth system.  Sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed.  A biparietal incision was performed.  A linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation.  A biparietal craniotomy was carried out, carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the Stealth stereotactic system.  The dura was opened and reflected back to the midline.  An inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor.  This was very delicate removing the tumor and the co-surgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor.  The tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels.  At least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region.  Bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally, however, was completely controlled.  Complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound.,Once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained, this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area.  A linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve.  Sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and Bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull.  A burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome.  A craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter.  It was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus.  Stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum.  The ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor, and this was draining CSF relieving pressure in the posterior fossa.  Upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region, the brain was noted to be extremely tight, thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy.,At the posterior fossa, a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly.  The tumor, as the one above, was removed, both piecemeal and with intraoperative Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator.  A gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well.,I then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the CP angle; however, this was just over the lower cranial nerves, and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss, this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter.,Meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well.,The posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers.  The dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 4-0 Nurolon.  The dura was watertight, and it was covered with blue glue.  Gelfoam was placed over the dural closure.  Then, the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using #0 Ethibond.  Subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 and 0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 Nylon.,For the cranial incision, the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound.  The bone flap was brought on to the field.  The dura was closed with running and interrupted 4-0 Nurolon.  At the beginning of the case, dural tack-ups had been made and these were still in place.  The sinuses, both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus, were covered with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses.,Once the dura was closed, the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the Lorenz microplates.  The wound was then closed in layers.  The galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running locking 3-0 Nylon.,Estimated blood loss for the case was more than 1 L.  The patient received 2 units of packed red cells during the case as well as more than 1 L of Hespan and almost 3 L of crystalloid.,Nevertheless, her vitals remained stable throughout the case, and we hopefully helped her survival and her long-term neurologic status for this really nice lady.",Neurology

On physical examination, she was derived to have a severely deviated septum with an S-shape deformity as well as turbinate hypertrophy present along the inferior turbinates contributing to the obstruction.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all risks, benefits, and alternatives have been discussed with the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operating Suite where she was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away.  Nasal pledgets saturated with 4 cc of 10% cocaine solution were inserted into the nasal cavities.  These were then removed and the nasal septum as well as the turbinates were localized with the mixture of 1% lidocaine with 1:100000 epinephrine solution.  The nasal pledgets were then reinserted as the patient was prepped in the usual fashion.  The nasal pledgets were again removed and the turbinates as well as an infraorbital nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine solution.  The nasal vestibules were then cleansed with a pHisoHex solution.  A #15 blade scalpel was then used to make an incision along the length of the caudal septum.  The mucoperichondrial junction was then identified with the aid of cotton-tipped applicator as well as the stitch scissor.  Once the plane was identified, the mucosal flap on the left side of the septum was elevated with the aid of a Cottle.  At this point it should be mentioned that the patient's septum was significantly deviated with a large S-shape deformity obstructing both the right and left nasal cavity with the convex portion present in the left nasal cavity.  Again, the Cottle elevator was used to raise the mucosal flap down to the level of the septal spur.  At this point, the septal knife was used to make a crossover incision through the cartilage just anterior to the septal spur.  Again, the mucosal flap was elevated in the right nasal septum.  Now Knight scissors were used to remove the ascending portion of the nasal cartilage, which was then removed with a Takahashi forceps.  A Cottle elevator was used to further elevate the mucosal flap off the septal spur on the left side.  Removal of the spur was performed with the aid of the septal knife as well as a 3 mm straight chisel.  Once all ascending cartilage has been removed, inspection of the nasal cavity revealed patent passages with the exception of inferior turbinates that were very hypertrophied and was felt to be contributing to the patient's symptoms.  Therefore, the turbinates were again localized and a #15 blade scalpel was used to make a vertical incision dissected down to the chondral bone.  The XPS microdebrider with the inferior turbinate blade was then inserted through the incision and a submucous resection was performed by passing the microdebrider along the length of the bone.  Once the submucosal tissue had been resected, an outfracture procedure was performed so as to fully open the nasal passages.  Inspection revealed very patent and nonobstructive nasal passages.  Now the caudal incision was reapproximated with #4-0 chromic suture.

The patient has had anorexia with decrease in appetite.  His physical examination revealed the patient to be febrile with the temperature of 102.4.  He had right lower quadrant and suprapubic tenderness with palpation with Rovsing sign and rebound consistent with acute surgical abdomen.  The patient was presumed acute appendicitis and was placed on IV antibiotics and recommended that he undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with possible open exploratory laparotomy.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed purulent drainage within the region of the right lower quadrant adjacent to the cecum and terminal ileum.  There was large amounts of purulent drainage.  The appendix was visualized, however, it was difficult to be visualized secondary to the acute inflammatory process, purulent drainage, and edema.  It was decided given the signs of perforation and purulent drainage within the abdomen that we would convert to an open exploratory laparotomy.  Upon exploration of the ileum, there was noted to be a ruptured Meckel's diverticulum, this was resected.  Additionally, the appendix appeared normal without evidence of perforation and/or edema and a decision to proceed with incidental appendectomy was performed.  The patient was irrigated with copious amounts of warmth normal saline approximately 2 to 3 liters.  The patient was closed and did develop some hypoxemia after closure.  He remained ventilated and was placed on a large amount of ________.  His hypoxia did resolve and he remained intubated and proceed to the Critical Care Complex or postop surgical care.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  He did receive preoperative IV antibiotics, sequential compression devices, NG tube placement with Foley catheter, and heparin subcutaneously.  The patient was intubated by the Anesthesia Department.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing a #10 blade scalpel, an infraumbilical incision was created.  The Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen.  The abdomen was insufflated to approximately 15 mmHg.  A #10 mm ablated trocar was inserted into the abdomen and a video laparoscope was inserted and the abdomen was explored and the above findings were noted.  A right upper quadrant 5 mm port was inserted to help with manipulation of bowel and to visualize the appendix.  Decision was then made to convert to exploratory laparotomy given the signs of acute perforation.  The instruments were then removed.  The abdomen was then deflated.  Utilizing ________ #10 blade scalpel, a midline incision was created from the xiphoid down to level of the pubic symphysis.,The incision was carried down with a #10 blade scalpel and the bleeding was controlled along the way with electrocautery.  The posterior layer of the rectus fascia and peritoneum was opened carefully with the scissors as the peritoneum had already been penetrated during laparoscopy.  Incision was carried down to the midline within the linea alba.  Once the abdomen was opened, there was noted to be gross purulent drainage.  The ileum was explored and there was noted to be a perforated Meckel's diverticulum.  Decision to resect the diverticulum was performed.,The blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was carefully dissected free and a #3-0 Vicryl was used to tie off the blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum.  Clamps were placed to the proximal supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was tied off with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The Meckel's diverticulum was noted to be completely free and was grasped anteriorly and utilizing a GIA stapling device, the diverticulum was transected.  There was noted to be a hemostatic region within the transection and staple line looked intact without evidence of perforation and/or leakage.  Next, decision was decided to go ahead and perform an appendectomy.  Mesoappendix was doubly clamped with hemostats and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  The appendiceal artery was identified and was clamped between two hemostats and transected as well.  Once the appendix was completely freed of the surrounding inflammation and adhesion.  A plain gut was placed at the base of the appendix and tied down.  The appendix was milked distally with a straight stat and clamped approximately halfway.  A second piece of plain gut suture was used to ligate above and then was transected with a #10 blade scalpel.  The appendiceal stump was then inverted with a pursestring suture of #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Once the ________ was completed, decision to place a JP drain within the right lower quadrant was performed.  The drain was positioned within the right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum and brought out through a separate site in the anterior abdominal wall.  It was sewn in place with a #3-0 nylon suture.  The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of warmed normal saline.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable for pathology.  The omentum was replaced over the bowel contents and utilizing #1-0 PDS suture, the abdominal wall, anterior and posterior rectus fascias were closed with a running suture.  Once the abdomen was completely closed, the subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the incision was closed with staples.  The previous laparoscopic sites were also closed with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed over the wound with Adaptic and 4x4s and covered with ABDs.  JPs replaced with bulb suction.  NG tube and Foley catheter were left in place.  The patient tolerated this procedure well with exception of hypoxemia which resolved by the conclusion of the case.,The patient will proceed to the Critical Care Complex where he will be closely evaluated and followed in his postoperative course.

Hypertension.,CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: , Stable.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , None.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient is a 44-year-old African-American male who was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis three times per week approximately four to five months ago.  He reports that over the past month, he has been feeling lightheaded when standing and has had three syncopal episodes during this time with return of consciousness after several minutes.  He reportedly had this even while seated and denied overt dizziness.  He reports this lightheadedness is made even worse when standing.  He has had these symptoms almost daily over the past month.  He does report some confusion when he awakens.  He reports that he loses consciousness for two to three minutes.  Denies any bowel or bladder loss, although he reports very little urine output secondary to his end-stage renal disease.  He denied any palpitations, warmth, or diaphoresis, which is indicative of vasovagal syncope.  There were no witnesses to his syncopal episodes.  He also denied any clonic activity and no history of seizures.  In the emergency room, the patient was given fluids and orthostatics were checked.  At that time, orthostatics were negative; however, due to the fact that fluid had been given before, it is impossible to rule out orthostatic hypotension.  The patient presented to the hospital on Coreg 12.5 mg b.i.d. and lisinopril 10 mg daily secondary to his hypertension, congestive heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy and end-stage renal disease.  Regarding his syncopal episodes, he was admitted with likely orthostatic hypotension.  Cardiology was consulted and their recommendations were to reduce the lisinopril to 5 mg daily.  At that time, the Coreg had been held secondary to hypotension.  Cardiology also ordered a nuclear medicine myocardial perfusion stress test.  Regarding the end-stage renal disease, Nephrology was consulted as the patient was due for hemodialysis treatment the day following admission.  Nephrology was able to perform dialysis on the patient and Renal concurred that the presyncopal symptoms were likely due to decreased intravascular volume in the postdialytic time frame.  Renal agreed with decreasing his lisinopril to 5 mg daily and decreasing the Coreg to 6.25 mg b.i.d.  They reported that the Procrit should be continued.  As previously indicated regarding the dilated cardiomyopathy, Cardiology ordered a nuclear medicine stress test to be performed.  Also, regarding the patient's hypertension, he actually was noted to have hypotension on admission, and as previously stated, the Coreg was originally discontinued and then it was restarted at 6.25 mg b.i.d. and the patient tolerated this well.  The patient's hospital course remained uncomplicated until September 17, 2007, the day the nuclear medicine stress test was scheduled.  The patient stated that he was reluctant to proceed with the test and he was afraid of needles and the risks associated with the test although the procedure was explained to the patient and the risks of the procedure were quit low, the patient proceeded to discharge himself against medical advice.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS:,The patient left AMA.

When seen in the Emergency Department, he was having no difficulty managing his secretions or any signs of any airway compromise.  Imaging in the Emergency Department did demonstrate an esophageal foreign body at or above the level of the cricopharyngeus.  Due to this, the patient was consented and taken urgently to the operating room for removal of this foreign body.,OPERATIVE DETAILS:,  The patient was correctly identified in the preop holding area and brought to operating room #37.  After informed consent was reviewed, general anesthesia was induced, initially with propofol, the existing IV.  Following this after protective eye tape was placed, #9 Parson's laryngoscope was introduced transorally and used to perform a direct laryngoscopy.  Normal anatomy was visualized.  Following this, a 4-mm, 20-rigid endoscope was introduced through the Parson's laryngoscope and used to perform a direct tracheoscopy.  The patient's supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis down to the level of the mid trachea were found to be benign with no abnormal-appearing anatomy.  Following this, the rigid endoscope was removed and the patient was intubated with a 4-0 endotracheal tube cuffed without difficulty.  After confirming bilateral breath sounds and positive end tidal CO2, this was secured to the patient by the anesthesia staff.  Following this, the Parson's laryngoscope was removed and a size 4 rigid esophagoscope was inserted transorally and passed down to the level of the patient's cricopharyngeus were the foreign body was visualized.  At this point, the coin grasper device was connected to the camera system and inserted through the existing esophagoscope.  This was used to grasp the coin and the coin was removed under direct visualization and handed off as a separate specimen.  Following this, the 34 mm 0-degree scope was inserted through the esophagoscope once the esophagoscope was passed down to the patient's GE junction.  The entire esophageal mucosa was examined as the esophagoscope was backed out and there was only a minimal amount of superficial ulceration in the posterior wall of the esophagus near the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle.  There were no other lesions or signs of further esophageal damage.  Following this, all instrumentation was removed, and care of the patient was turned back to the anesthesia staff for stable wakeup.,FINDINGS:,1.

4674,"HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 13-year-old, who has a history of Shone complex and has a complete heart block.  He is on the pacemaker.  He had a coarctation of the aorta and that was repaired when he was an infant.  He was followed in our Cardiology Clinic here and has been doing well.  However last night, he was sleeping, and he states he felt as if he has having a dream, and there was thunder in this dream, which woke him up.  He then felt that his defibrillator was going off and this has continued and feels like his heart rate is not normal.  Thus, his dad put him in the car and transported him here.  He has been evaluated here.  He had some scar tissue at one point when the internal pacemaker was not working properly and had to have that replaced.  It was 2 a.m. when he woke, and again, he was brought here by private vehicle.  He was well prior to going to bed.  No cough, cold, runny nose, fever.  No trauma has been noted.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Shone complex, pacemaker dependent.,MEDICATIONS: , He is on no medications at this time.,ALLERGIES:,  He has no allergies.,IMMUNIZATIONS:,  Up to date.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He lives with his parents.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative.,REVIEW OF SYSTEM: , Twelve asked, all negative, except as noted above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  This is an awake, alert male, who appears to be in mild distress.,HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  His TMs are clear.  His nares are clear.  The mucous membranes are pink and moist.  Throat is clear.,NECK:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or masses.  Trachea is midline.,LUNGS:  Clear.,HEART:  Shows bradycardia at 53.  He has good distal pulses.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  Positive bowel sounds.  No guarding, no rebound.  No rashes are seen.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Initial blood pressure is 164/90.  He was moved in room 1.  He was placed on nasal cannula.  Pulse ox was 100%, which is normal.  We placed him on a monitor.  We did an EKG; it has not appear to be capturing his pacemaker at this time.  Shortly after the patient's arrival, the Medtronic technician came and worked out his pacemaker.  Medtronic representative informed me that the lead that he has in place has been recalled because it has been prone to microfractures, oversensing, and automatic defibrillation.  As noted, he was transferred to room 1, placed on a monitor, pulse ox.  An IV was placed.  A standard blood work was sent.  A chest x-ray was done showing normal heart size, lead appeared to be in placed.  There was no evidence of pulmonary edema.  His pacemaker did not appear to be capturing.  We placed him on transthoracic leads.  However, it is difficult to get good placement with these because of the area where his pacemaker was placed.  The Medtronic technician initially turned off his defibrillation mode and turned down his sensor.  However, we could not get our transthoracic pacer to capture his heart.  When the Medtronic representative turned off the pacemaker, the heart rate seemed to drop into the 40s.  The patient appeared to be in pain.  We placed it back on a rate of 60 at that time.  He has remained in sinus bradycardia, but no evidence of ectopic beats.  No widening of his QRS complex.  I spoke with Cardiology.  Cardiology service has come in, has evaluated him at bedside with me.  Again, we turned up the transthoracic pacer, but it is again not seem to be picking up, and his heart rate is still going with the Medtronic's internal pacemaker.  So with the ICU physician on call, Dr. X, he has agreed with taking this young man to the ICU.,An hour after presentation here, the ICU was ready for bed.  I accompanied the patient up to the ICU.  He remained awake and alert.  Initially, he was complaining of a lot of chest pain.  Once the defibrillator was turned off, he had no more pain.  He was transported to the Pediatrics PICU and delivered in stable condition.,LABORATORY DATA: , CBC was normal.  Chem-20 was normal as well.,IMPRESSION:  ,Complete heart block with pacemaker malfunction.,PLAN:  ,He is admitted to the ICU.,TIME SEEN: , Critical care time outside billable procedures was 45 minutes with this patient.

Laryngeal edema.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Tracheostomy change.  A #6 Shiley with proximal extension was changed to a #6 Shiley with proximal extension.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 60-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital with exacerbation of COPD and CHF.  The patient had subsequently been taken to the operating room by Department of Otolaryngology and a direct laryngoscope was performed.  The patient was noted at that time to have transglottic edema.  Biopsies were taken.  At the time of surgery, it was decided that the patient required a tracheostomy for maintenance of continued ventilation and airway protection.  The patient is currently postop day #6 and appears to be unable to be weaned from ventilator at this time and may require prolonged ventricular support.  A decision was made to perform tracheostomy change.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was seen in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was placed in a supine position.  The neck was then extended.  The sutures that were previously in place in the #6 Shiley with proximal extension were removed.  The patient was preoxygenated to 100%.  After several minutes, the patient was noted to have a pulse oximetry of 100%.  The IV tubing that was supporting the patient's trache was then cut.  The tracheostomy tube was then suctioned.,The inner cannula was then removed from the tracheostomy and a nasogastric tube was placed down the lumen of the tracheostomy tube as a guidewire.  The tracheostomy tube was then removed over the nasogastric tube and the operative field was suctioned.  With the guidewire in place and with adequate visualization, a new #6 Shiley with proximal extension was then passed over the nasogastric tube guidewire and carefully inserted into the trachea.  The guidewire was then removed and the inner cannula was then placed into the tracheostomy.  The patient was then reconnected to the ventilator and was noted to have normal tidal volumes.  The patient had a tidal volume of 500 and was returning 500 cc to 510 cc.  The patient continued to saturate well with saturations 99%.  The patient appeared comfortable and her vital signs were stable.  A soft trache collar was then connected to the trachesotomy.  A drain sponge was then inserted underneath the new trache site.  The patient was observed for several minutes and was found to be in no distress and continued to maintain adequate saturations and continued to return normal tidal volumes.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well.  0.25% acetic acid soaks were ordered to the drain sponge every shift.",Surgery

He underwent screw compression for the fracture in October 2007.  The fracture has subsequently healed and the patient presents for hardware removal.  The risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery include the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of extremity, failure of removal of hardware, failure to relieve pain or improved range of motion.  All questions were answered and the family agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient's left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  Using his previous incision, dissection was carried down through the screw.  A guide wire was placed inside the screw and the screw was removed without incident.  The patient had an extension lag of about 15 to 20 degrees.  Elbow is manipulated and his arm was able to be extended to zero degrees dorsiflex.  The washer was also removed without incident.  Wound was then irrigated and closed using #2-0 Vicryl and #4-0 Monocryl.  Wound was injected with 0.25% Marcaine.  The wound was then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x4 and bias.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and subsequently taken to the recovery in stable condition.,DISCHARGE NOTE: , The patient will be discharged on date of surgery.  He is to follow up in one week's time for a wound check.  This can be done at his primary care physician's office.  The patient should keep his postop dressing for about 4 to 5 days.  He may then wet the wound, but not scrub it.  The patient may resume regular activities in about 2 weeks.  The patient was given Tylenol with Codeine 10 mL p.o. every 3 to 4 hours p.r.n.",Orthopedic

The patient has had approximately four to five episodes of adenotonsillitis per year for the last three to four years.,PROCEDURE: , Informed consent was properly obtained from the patient's parents and the patient was taken to the operating room #3 and was placed in a supine position.  He was placed under general endotracheal tube anesthesia by the Department of Anesthesia.  The bed was then rolled away from Department of Anesthesia.  A shoulder roll was then placed beneath the shoulder blades and a blue towel was then fashioned as a turban wrap.  The McIvor mouth gag was carefully positioned into the patient's mouth with attention to avoid the teeth.,The retractor was then opened and the oropharynx was visualized.  The adenoid pad was then visualized with a laryngeal mirror.  The adenoids appeared to be 1+ and non-obstructing.  There was no evidence of submucosal cleft palate palpable.  There was no evidence of bifid uvula.  A curved Allis clamp was then used to grasp the superior pole of the right tonsil.  The tonsil was then retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision on the mucosa of the right anterior tonsillar pillar to find the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using a Bovie.  Tonsillar sponge was re-applied to the tonsillar fossa.  Suction cautery was then used to adequately obtain hemostasis with the tonsillar fossa.  Attention was then directed to the left tonsil.  The curved Allis was used to grasp the superior pole of the left tonsil and it was retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision in the mucosa of the left anterior tonsillar pillar and define the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using the Bovie.  Next, complete hemostasis was achieved within the tonsillar fossae using suction cautery.  After adequate hemostasis was obtained, attention was directed towards the adenoid pad.  The adenoid pad was again visualized and appeared 1+ and was non-obstructing.  Decision was made to use suction cautery to cauterize the adenoids.  Using a laryngeal mirror under direct visualization, the adenoid pad was then cauterized with care to avoid the eustachian tube orifices as well as the soft palate and inferior turbinates.  After cauterization was complete, the nasopharynx was again visualized and tonsillar sponge was applied.  Adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The tonsillar fossae were again visualized and no evidence of bleeding was evident.  The throat pack was removed from the oropharynx and the oropharynx was suctioned.  There was no evidence of any further bleeding.  A flexible suction catheter was then used to suction out the nasopharynx to the oropharynx.  The suction catheter was also used to suction up the stomach.  Final look revealed no evidence of further bleeding and 10 mg of Decadron was given intraoperatively.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient tolerated the procedure well and the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition.",ENT - Otolaryngology

Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  IV antibiotic was given.  The dorsal hood was retracted and the patient was then sterilely prepped and draped.  A stay stitch of 4-0 Prolene was then placed in the glans for traction.  His urethra was calibrated, it was quite thin, to a 10-French with the straight sounds.  We then marked the coronal cuff and the urethral plate as well as the penile shaft skin with marking pen and incised the coronal cuff circumferentially and then around the urethral plate with the 15 blade knife and then degloved the penis with a curved tenotomy scissors.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The ventral chordee tissue was removed.  We then placed a vessel loop tourniquet around the base of the penis and using IV grade saline did an artificial erection test, which showed that he had a persistent chordee.  In the midline a 15 blade knife was used to incise Buck fascia after marking the area of chordee with the marking pen.  We then used a Heinecke-Mikulicz Nesbit tuck with 5-0 Prolene to straighten the penis.  Artificial erection again performed showed the penis was straight.  The knot was buried with figure-of-eight suture of 7-0 Vicryl in Buck fascia above it.  We then left the tourniquet in place and then after marking the urethral plate incised it and enlarged it with Beaver blade and a 15 blade.  We then elevated the glanular wings as well in the similar fashion.  An 8-French Zaontz catheter was then placed and the urethral plate was then closed over this with a distal interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl and then a running subcuticular closure of 7-0 Vicryl to close the defect.  We then put the stay sutures in the inter-preputial skin with 7-0 Vicryl and then rotated a flap using the subcutaneous tissue after dissecting it down to the pubis at the base of the penile shaft on the dorsum using the curved iris scissors.  We buttonholed the flap and then placed it through the penis as a sleeve.  Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl then used to reapproximate and to tack this flap and place over the urethroplasty.  Once this was done, a two 5-0 Vicryl deep sutures were placed in the glans to rotate the glans and allow for hemostasis.  Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were then used to create the neomeatus and horizontal mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl used to reconstitute the glans.  We then removed the excessive preputial skin and using tacking sutures of 6-0 chromic tacked the penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff and on the ventrum we dropped a portion of the skin down on the left side of the penis to reconstitute the penoscrotal junction using horizontal mattress sutures.  We then closed the ventral defect.  Once this was done, the stay suture in the glans was used to keep the Zaontz catheter to tack it into place.  We then used Surgicel, Dermabond, and Telfa dressing with Mastisol and an eye tape to keep the dressing in place.  IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure.  The patient was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.",Surgery
3070,"XYZ, D.C.,Re:  ABC,Dear Dr. XYZ:,I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, ABC, today MM/DD/YYYY in consultation.  He is an unfortunate 19-year-old right-handed male who was injured in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY, where he was the driver of an automobile, which was struck on the front passenger's side.  The patient sustained impact injuries to his neck and lower back.  There was no apparent head injury or loss of consciousness and he denied any posttraumatic seizures.  He was taken to Hospital, x-rays were taken, apparently which were negative and he was released.,At the present time, he complains of neck and lower back pain radiating into his right arm and right leg with weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling in his right arm and right leg.  He has had no difficulty with bowel or bladder function.  He does experience intermittent headaches associated with his neck pain with no other associated symptoms.,PAST HEALTH:,  He was injured in a prior motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY.  At the time of his most recent injuries, he was completely symptom free and under no active therapy.  There is no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, neurological disorders, ulcers or tuberculosis.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , He denies tobacco or alcohol consumption.,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,None.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Otherwise noncontributory.,FUNCTIONAL INQUIRY: , Otherwise noncontributory.,REVIEW OF DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:,  Includes an MRI scan of the cervical spine dated MM/DD/YYYY which showed evidence for disc bulging at the C6-C7 level.  MRI scan of the lumbar spine on MM/DD/YYYY, showed evidence of a disc herniation at the L1-L2 level as well as a disc protrusion at the L2-L3 level with disc herniations at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 level and disc protrusion at the L5-S1 level.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Reveals an alert and oriented male with normal language function.  Vital Signs:  Blood pressure was 105/68 in the left arm sitting.  Heart rate was 70 and regular.  Height was 5 feet 8 inches.  Weight was 182 pounds.  Cranial nerve evaluation was unremarkable.  Pupils were equal and reactive.  Funduscopic evaluation was clear.  There was no evidence for nystagmus.  There was decreased range of motion noted in both the cervical and lumbar regions to a significant degree, with tenderness and spasm in the paraspinal musculature.  Straight leg raising was limited to 45 degrees on the right and 90 degrees on the left.  Motor strength was 5/5 on the MRC scale.  Reflexes were 2+ symmetrical and active.  No pathological responses were noted.  Sensory examination showed a diffuse decreased sensation to pinprick in the right upper extremity.  Cerebellar function was normal.  There was normal station and gait.  Chest and cardiovascular evaluations were unremarkable.  Heart sounds were normal.  There were no extra sounds or murmurs.  Palpable trigger points were noted in the right trapezius and right cervical and lumbar paraspinal musculature.,CLINICAL IMPRESSION: , Reveals a 19-year-old male suffering from a posttraumatic cervical and lumbar radiculopathy, secondary to traumatic injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY.  In view of the persistent radicular complaints associated with the weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling as well as the objective sensory loss noted on today's evaluation as well as the non-specific nature of the radiculopathy, I have scheduled him for an EMG study on his right upper and right lower extremity in two week's time to rule out any nerve root irritation versus any peripheral nerve entrapment or plexopathy as the cause of his symptoms.  Palpable trigger points were noted on today's evaluation.  He is suffering from ongoing myofascitis.  His treatment plan will consist of a series of trigger point injections to be initiated at his next follow up visit in two weeks' time.  I have encouraged him to continue with his ongoing treatment program under your care and supervision.  I will be following him in two weeks' time.

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox and Ocular. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A speculum was placed on the eyelids and microscope was brought into position. A #7-0 Vicryl suture was passed through the superotemporal limbus and traction suture was placed at the superotemporal limbus and the eye was rotated infranasally so as to expose the superotemporal conjunctiva. At this point, smooth forceps and Westcott scissors were used to create a 100-degree superotemporal conjunctival peritomy, approximately 2 mm posterior to the superotemporal limbus. This was then dissected anteriorly to the limbus edge and then posteriorly. Steven scissors were then dissected in a superotemporal quadrant between the superior and lateral rectus muscles to provide good exposure. At this point, we primed the Ahmed valve with a #27 gauge cannula using BSS and it was noted to be patent. We then placed Ahmed valve in the superotemporal subconjunctival recess underneath the subtenon space and this was pushed posteriorly. We then measured with calipers so that it was positioned 9 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed valve was then tacked down with #8-0 nylon suture through both fenestrations. We then applied light cautery to the superotemporal episcleral bed. We placed a paracentesis at the temporal position and inflated the anterior chamber with a small amount of Healon. We then used a #23 gauge needle and entered the superotemporal sclera, approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus into the anterior chamber away from iris and away from cornea. We then trimmed the tube, beveled up in a 30 degree fashion with Vannas scissors, and introduced the tube through the #23 gauge tract into the anterior chamber so that approximately 2-3 mm of tube was extending into the anterior chamber. We burped some of the Healon out of the anterior chamber and filled it with BSS and we felt that the tube was in good position away from the lens, away from the cornea, and away from the iris. We then tacked down the tubes to the sclera with #8-0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of- eight fashion. The pericardium was soaked in gentamicin. We then folded the pericardium 1x1 cm piece onto itself and then placed it over the tube and this was tacked down in all four quadrants to the sclera with #8-0 nylon suture. At this point, we then re-approximated the conjunctiva to its original position and we closed it with an #8-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle in a running fashion with interrupted locking bites. We then removed the traction suture. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was deep, the tube appeared to be well positioned. The remaining portion of the Healon was burped out of the anterior chamber with BSS and the pressure was felt to be adequate. The speculum was removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Then, an eye patch and shield were placed over the eye. The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",Surgery

On bimanual exam, the uterus was enlarged, movable, and anteverted.  The intraabdominal findings revealed normal liver margin, kidneys, and stomach upon palpation.  The uterus was found to be normal in size with evidence of endometriosis on the uterus.  The right ovary and fallopian tube were absent.  The left fallopian tube and ovary appeared normal with evidence of a small functional cyst.  There was evidence of left adnexal adhesion to the pelvic side wall which was filmy, unable to be bluntly dissected.  There were multiple interloop bowel adhesions that were filmy in nature noted.,The appendix was absent.  There did appear to be old suture in a portion of the bowel most likely from a prior procedure.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 45-year-old African-American gravida7, para3-0-0-3, who is here for definitive treatment of chronic pelvic pain with a history of endometriosis.  She did have a laparoscopic ablation of endometriosis on a laparoscopy and also has a history of right salpingo-oophorectomy.  She has tried Lupron and did stop secondary to the side effects.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the Operating Suite and placed under general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and placed in the dorsal supine position.  An indwelling Foley catheter was placed.  With the skin knife, an incision was made removing the old cicatrix.  A Bovie was used to carry the tissue through to the underlying layer of the fascia which was incised in the midline and extended with the Bovie.  The rectus muscle was then sharply and bluntly dissected off the superior aspect of the rectus fascia in the superior as well as the inferior aspect using the Bovie.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline using a hemostat and the peritoneum was entered bluntly.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with Metzenbaum scissors with careful visualization of the bladder.  At this point, the intraabdominal cavity was manually explored and the above findings were noted.  A Lahey clamp was then placed on the fundus of the uterus and the uterus was brought to the surgical field.  The bowel was then packed with moist laparotomy sponges.  Prior to this, the filmy adhesions leftover were taken down.  At this point, the left round ligament was identified, grasped with two hemostats, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  At this point, the broad ligament was dissected down and the lost portion of the bladder flap was created.  The posterior aspect of the peritoneum was also dissected.  At this point, the infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated and three tie of #0 Vicryl was used to isolate the pedicle.  Two hemostats were then placed across the pedicle and this was transected with the scalpel.  This was then suture ligated in Heaney fashion.  The right round ligament was then identified and in the similar fashion, two hemostats were placed across the round ligament and using the Mayo scissors the round ligament was transected and dissected down the broad ligament to create the bladder flap anteriorly as well as dissect the posterior peritoneum and isolate the round ligament.  This was then ligated with three tie of #0 Vicryl.  Also incorporated in this was the remnant from the previous right salpingo-oophorectomy.  At this point, the bladder flap was further created with sharp dissection as well as the moist Ray-Tech to push the bladder down off the anterior portion of the cervix.,The left uterine artery was then skeletonized and a straight Heaney was placed.  In a similar fashion, the contralateral uterine artery was skeletonized and straight Heaney clamp was placed.  These ligaments bilaterally were transected and suture ligated in a left Heaney stitch.  At this point, curved Masterson was used to incorporate the cardinal ligament complex, thus was transected and suture ligated.  Straight Masterson was then used to incorporate the uterosacrals bilaterally and this was also transected and suture ligated.  Prior to ligating the uterine arteries, the uterosacral arteries were tagged bilaterally with #0 Vicryl.  At this point, the roticulator was placed across the vaginal cuff and snug underneath the entire cervix.  The roticulator was then clamped and removed and the staple line was in place.  This was found to be hemostatic.  A suture was then placed through each cuff angle bilaterally and cardinal ligament complex was found to be fixed to each apex bilaterally.  At this point, McCall culdoplasty was performed with an #0 Vicryl incorporating each uterosacral as well as the posterior peritoneum.  There did appear to be good support on palpation.  Prior to this, the specimen was handed off and sent to pathology.  At this point, there did appear to be small amount of oozing at the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis was obtained using a #0 Vicryl in two single stitches.  Good hemostasis was then obtained on the cuff as well as the pedicles.  Copious irrigation was performed at this point with lactate Ringers.  The round ligaments were then incorporated into the cuff bilaterally.  Again, copious amount of irrigation was performed and good hemostasis was obtained.  At this point, the peritoneum was reapproximated in a single interrupted stitch on the left and right lateral aspects to cover each pedicle bilaterally.  At this point, the bowel packing as well as moist Ray-Tech was removed and while re-approximating the bowel it was noted that there were multiple interloop bowel adhesions which were taken down using the Metzenbaum scissors with good visualization of the underlying bowel.  Good hemostasis was obtained of these sites as well.  The sigmoid colon was then returned to its anatomic position and the omentum as well.  The rectus muscle was then reapproximated with two interrupted sutures of #2-0 Vicryl.  The fascia was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion from lateral to medial meeting in the midline.  The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with #3-0 plain in a running suture.  The skin was then re-approximated with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular closure.  This was dressed with an Op-Site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle were correct x2.  After the procedure, the patient was extubated and brought out of general anesthesia.  She will go to the floor where she will be followed postoperatively in the hospital.",Obstetrics / Gynecology

The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsolateral aspect of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 4-cm linear incision was placed over the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and lateral to the course of the extensor digitorum longus to the fifth left toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the soft tissue attachments through the fifth left metatarsal head were mobilized.  The lateral and plantar aspect of the fifth left metatarsal head were adequately exposed and using the sagittal saw a lateral and plantar condylectomy of the fifth left metatarsal head were then achieved.  The bony prominences were removed and passed off the operating table to be sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining sharp edges of the fifth left metatarsal head were then smoothened with the use of a dental rasp.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  Then, 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl suture materials were used to approximate the periosteal, capsular, and subcutaneous tissues respectively.  The incision was reinforced with Steri-Strips.  Range of motion of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint was tested and was found to be excellent and uninhibited.  The patient's left ankle tourniquet at this time was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage and the patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given pain medications and instructions on how to control her postoperative course.  She was discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was will follow up with Dr. X in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.",Orthopedic

Then it was let down for approximately 15 minutes and then reinflated for another 26 minutes for a total of 149 minutes.,COMPONENTS: , A Zimmer NexGen Legacy knee size D right stemmed femoral component was used.  A NexGen femoral component with a distal femoral augmented block, size 5 mm.  A NexGen tibial component, size 3 mm was used.  A size 14 mm constrained polyethylene surface was used as well.  Original patellar component that the patient had was maintained.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,BRIEF HISTORY:,  The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of knee pain for 13 years.  She had previous total knee arthroplasty and revision at an outside facility.  She had continued pain, snapping, malalignment, difficulty with ambulation, and giving away and wished to undergo additional revision surgery.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed on the operating table.  Department of Anesthesia administered the spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the patient was placed in a supine position.  Care was ensured and she was adequately secured and well padded in position.  Once this was obtained, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was inflated to approximately 325 mmHg on the right thigh.  At this point, an incision was made over her anterior previous knee scar taking this down to the subcutaneous tissue of the overlying retinaculum.  A medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then made by using a second knife and this was taken both distally and proximally to allow us to sublux the patella on the lateral aspect to allow exposure to the joint surface.  There was noted to be no evidence of purulence or gross clinical appearance of infection, however, intraoperative cultures were taken to asses this as well.  At this point, the previous articular surface was then removed using an osteotome until this was left free and then removed.  This was done without difficulty.  Attention was then directed removing the femoral component.  Osteotome was taken around each of the edges until this was gently lifted up and then a femoral extractor was placed around it and this was back flapped until this was easily removed.  After this was performed, attention was then directed to the tibial component.  An osteotome was again inserted around the surface and this was easily pried loose.  There was noted to be minimal difficulty with this and did not appear to have adequate cement fixation.  This was evaluated.  The bone stalk appeared to be adequate, however, there were noted to be some deficits where we need to trim cement, so we elected to proceed with stemmed component.  The attention was first directed to the femur and the femoral canal was opened up and superficially reamed up to a size 18 mm proximal portion for the Zimmer stemmed component.  At this point, the distal femoral cut was evaluated with a intramedullary guide and this was noted to be cut in a varus cut leaving us a large deficit of the medial femoral cut.  We elected because of this large amount of retic to take off the medial condyle to correct this varus cut to a six degree valgus cut.  We elected to augment the medial aspect and take only 5 mm off of the lateral condyle instead of a full 10 to 12.  At this point, the distal femoral cutting guide based on the intramedullary head was then placed.  Care was ensured that this was aligned in proper rotation with the external epicondylar axis.  Once this was pinned in position, approximately a six degree valgus cut was then made.  This allowed a portion of the medial condyle to be removed distally.  The anterior cut was checked next using the intramedullary guide.  The anterior surface cutting block was then placed.  This aligned us to anterior cutting block.,We ensured again that rotation was aligned with the epicondylar axis.  Once this was adequately aligned with this and gave us some external rotation, this was pinned in position and new anterior cut was made.  It was noted that minimal bone was taken off the surface, only a slight portion on the medial anterior surface.  _______ was then removed and the chamfer cutting guide was then placed on.  This allowed us to make a box cut and recut some of the angled cuts of the distal femur.  Once this was placed and pinned in position.  Care was then again taken to check that this was in proper rotation and then the chamfer cuts were recut.  It was noted that the anterior chamfers did not need to be cut, take off no bone.  The posterior chamfers did remove some bony aspects.  This was also taken off some of the posterior aspects of the condyles and then the ossicle saw and reciprocal saw were used to take off a notch cut to open up a constrained component.  After all these cuts were taken, the guides were then removed and the trial component with a medial 5 mm augment was then placed.  This appeared to have an adequate fit and then packed in position.  It appeared to be satisfactory.  At this point, this was removed and attention was then directed to the tibia.  The intramedullary canal was again opened up using a proximal drill and this was reamed to the appropriate size until good _______ was obtained.  At this point, the intramedullary guide was used to evaluate a tibial cut.  This appeared to be adequate, however, we elected to remove 2 mm of bone to give us a new fresh bony surface.  The cutting guide was placed in adequate alignment and checked both the with intramedullary guide and an external alignment rod, which allowed us to ensure that we had proper external rotation of this tibial component.  At this point, this was pinned in position and the tibial cut was made to remove an extra 2 mm of bone.  This was again removed and a trial tibial stemmed component was then placed as well as the trial augmented stemmed femoral component.  This was placed in a proper position.  A 10 mm articular surface was placed in the knee and this was taken through range of motion.  This was found to have better alignment and satisfactory position.  We elected to take an intraoperative x-ray at this point, to evaluate our cut.  The intraoperative x-ray demonstrates satisfactory cuts and alignment of the prosthesis.  At this point, all trials were removed.  The patella was then examined.  The rongeur was used to remove the surrounding synovium.  The patella was evaluated and found to have mild wear on the lateral aspect of the inferior butt, however, this was very mild and overall had a good position and was well fixed to the bone.  It was elected at this time to maintain this anatomic patella that was previously placed.  At this point, the joint again was reevaluated and any bone loose fragments removed.  There was noted to be some posterior tightness and mild osteophytes.  These were removed with a rongeur.,At this time, while preparing the canals, the tourniquet was deflated due to it being 123 minutes.  Approximately 10 minutes did get by, as the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dried.  The tourniquet was then reinflated.  The canals were prepped for cementing.  They were suction-dried and cleaned.  The tibial component was cemented and then impacted into position and ensured it was adequately aligned in proper external rotation and alignment that was previously tried with the trial.  Once this was fixed and secured, all extra cement was removed and attention was directed to the femoral component.  The stemmed femoral component was then impacted in position and cemented.  Again care was ensured that it was in adequate position and proper rotation.  A size 14 mm poly was then inserted in between to provide compression.  This was then taken through extension and held until cement cured.  This was then removed and the components were evaluated.  All excess cement was removed and they were well fixed.  Size 14 mm trial Poly was then placed and this was taken through range of motion.  This was found to have excellent range of motion and good stability.  It was elected at this time that we would go with the size 14 mm Poly.  This gave us extra Poly for ware and then provide excellent contact throughout the range of motion.  The final articular surface was then placed and tightened into position to allow to _______ secured.  The knee was then reduced and the knee was taken through range of motion.  The patella was tracking with no-touch technique and adequately positioned.  At this point, the tourniquet was deflated for second time and then the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  All bleeding was cauterized using a Bovie cautery.  The retinaculum was then repaired using #1 Ethibond in a figure-of-eight fashion.  This was reinforced with a running #2-0 Vicryl.  The knee was then flexed and noted that the patella was tracking with good alignment.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  A drain was placed prior to retinaculum repair deep to this to provide adequate drainage.  At this point, the subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was approximated with skin clips.  Sterile dressing of Adaptic, 4x4, Webril, and ABDs were then placed.  A large Dupre dressing was then placed up the entire lower extremity.  The patient was then transferred back to recovery in supine position.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition.",Surgery

Digital rectal examination was done, which was normal.  Endoscope was introduced and passed through a rather spastic tortuous sigmoid colon with multiple diverticula seen all the way through transverse colon where about 1 cm x 1 cm sessile polyp was seen.  It was biopsied and then in piecemeal fashion removed using snare polypectomy after base was infiltrated with epinephrine.  Pedunculated polyp next to it was hard to see and there was a lot of peristalsis.  The scope then was advanced through rest of the transverse colon to ascending colon and cecum.  Terminal ileum was briefly reviewed, appeared normal and so did cecum after copious amount of fecal material was irrigated out.  Ascending colon was unremarkable.  At hepatic flexure may be proximal transverse colon, there was a sessile polyp about 1.2 cm x 1 cm that was removed in the same manner with a biopsy taken, base infiltrated with epinephrine and at least two passes of snare polypectomy and subsequent hot biopsy cautery removed to hold polypoid tissue, which could be seen.  In transverse colon on withdrawal and relaxation with epinephrine, an additional 1 mm to 2 mm sessile polyp was removed by hot biopsy.  Then in the transverse colon, additional larger polyp about 1.3 cm x 1.2 cm was removed in piecemeal fashion again with epinephrine, sclerotherapy, and snare polypectomy.  Subsequently pedunculated polyp in distal transverse colon near splenic flexure was removed with snare polypectomy.  The rest of the splenic flexure and descending colon were unremarkable.  Diverticulosis was again seen with almost constant spasm despite of glucagon.  Sigmoid colon did somewhat hinder the inspection of that area.

3708,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Empyema of the left chest and consolidation of the left lung.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Empyema of the left chest, consolidation of the left lung, lung abscesses of the left upper lobe and left lower lobe.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Left thoracoscopy and left thoracotomy with declaudication and drainage of lung abscesses, and multiple biopsies of pleura and lung.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,FINDINGS: , The patient has a complex history, which goes back about four months ago when she started having respiratory symptoms and one week ago she was admitted to another hospital with hemoptysis and on her evaluation there which included two CAT scans of chest she was found to have marked consolidation of the left lung with a questionable lung abscess or cavity with hydropneumothorax.  There was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung.  The patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking.  A chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor.  Then an abdominal CT scan was done, which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal CT.  The patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room, where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed.  The patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions, but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out.  This was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline ***** in the bronchus.  Following the bronchoscopy, a double lumen tube was placed, but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day.,The patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment.  Today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted.  These were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus.  Eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that.  The chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract.  A second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.  Therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.  Remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe.  There were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it.  There was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.  The adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.  There seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed.  Many cultures were taken from several areas.  The most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.,The apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm.,PROCEDURE AND TECHNIQUE:,  With the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the Thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this.  Therefore, the next incision for Thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved, but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy.  Therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made, entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space.  Quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity.  Specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense.  Suture ligatures of Prolene were required.  When the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a ""tissue pledget"" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with Prolene sutures.,Also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-French Foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the Foley catheter was removed.  The patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear.  A similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity.  Also on the pulmonary artery repair some ***** material was used and also thrombin, Gelfoam and Surgicel.  After reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline.  As mentioned, biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung.  Then two #24 Blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk.  One was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex.  These were later connected to water-seal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure.,Good hemostasis was observed.  Sponge count was reported as being correct.  Intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out.  Then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib.  Metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture, but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table, so that pericostal sutures were used with #1 Vicryl.  The chest wall was closed with running #1 Vicryl and then 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin.  The chest tubes were connected to water-seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was turned in the supine position where the double lumen endotracheal tube was switched out with single lumen.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.",ENT - Otolaryngology

For this reason, Dr. X and I agreed to operate on this patient together.  Please note that two surgeons were required for this case due to the complexity of it.  The indications and risks of the procedure were explained and the patient gave her informed consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating suite and placed in the supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was given with a double lumen tube.  The patient was positioned for a left thoracotomy.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A muscle sparing incision was created several centimeters anterior to the tip of the scapula.  The serratus and latissimus muscles were retracted.  The intercostal space was opened.  We then created a thoracoscopy port inferiorly through which we placed a camera for lighting and for visualization.  Through our small anterior thoracotomy and with the video-assisted scope placed inferiorly we had good visualization of the posterior mediastinum mass.  This was in the upper portion of the mediastinum just posterior to the subclavian artery and aorta.  The lung was deflated and allowed to retract anteriorly.  With a combination of blunt and sharp dissection and with attention paid to hemostasis, we were able to completely resect the posterior mediastinal mass.  We began by opening the tumor and taking a very wide large biopsy.  This was sent for frozen section, which revealed a benign nerve sheath tumor.  Then, using the occluder device Dr. X was able to _____ the inferior portions of the mass.  This left the external surface of the mass much more malleable and easier to retract.  Using a bipolar cautery and endoscopic scissors we were then able to completely resect it.  Once the tumor was resected, it was then sent for permanent sections.  The entire hemithorax was copiously irrigated and hemostasis was complete.  In order to prevent any lymph leak, we used 2 cc of Evicel and sprayed this directly on to the raw surface of the pleural space.  A single chest tube was inserted through our thoracoscopy port and tunneled up one interspace.  The wounds were then closed in multiple layers.  A #2 Vicryl was used to approximate the ribs.  The muscles of the chest wall were allowed to return to their normal anatomic position.  A 19 Blake was placed in the subcutaneous tissues.  Subcutaneous tissues and skin were closed with running absorbable sutures.  The patient was then rolled in the supine position where she was awakened from general endotracheal anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

It has been progressively getting more painful at this time.  The patient attempted conservative treatment including wider shoe gear without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preop holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amount of Webril were placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo and digital block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinette was reflected.  The foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  An incision was created over this area approximately 6 cm in length.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was then dissected from the capsule.  Care was taken to preserve the neurovascular bundle.  Dorsal linear capsular incision was then created.  The capsule was then reflected from the head of the first metatarsal.  Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was performed until the abductor tendons were identified and transected.  A lateral capsulotomy was performed.  Attention was then directed back to the medial eminence where sagittal saw was used to resect the prominent medial eminence.  The incision was then extended proximally with further dissection down to the level of the bone.  Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted as access guides for the SCARF osteotomy.  A standard SCARF osteotomy was then performed.  The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally in order to reduce the first interspace in the metatarsal angle.  After adequate reduction of the bunion deformity was noted, the bone was temporarily fixated with a 0.45 K-wire.  A 3.0 x 12 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion with compression noted.  A second 3.0 x 14 mm screw was also inserted with tight compression noted.  The remaining prominent medial eminence medially was then resected with a sagittal saw.  Reciprocating rasps were then used to smooth any sharp bony edges.  The temporary fixation wires were then removed.  The screws were again checked for tightness, which was noted.  Attention was directed to the medial capsule where a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed.  A straight stat was used to assist in removing a portion of the capsule.  The capsule was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl medially.  Dorsal capsule was then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous closure was performed with #4-0 Vicryl followed by running subcuticular stitch with #5-0 Vicryl.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress type fashion.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  A dorsal linear incision was then created over the proximal phalangeal joint of the left second toe.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade and the skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected off the capsule to be aligned laterally.  An incision was made on either side of the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  A curved mosquito stat was then used to reflex the tendon laterally.  The joint was identified and the medial collateral ligamentous attachments were resected off the head of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal saw was then used to resect the head of the proximal head.  The bone was then rolled and the lateral collateral attachments were transected and the bone was removed in toto.  The extensor digitorum longus tendon was inspected and noted to be intact.  Any sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  Pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and an immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.

Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery.,I dissected the sheath superficially free of any other structures, specifically the superficial radial nerve.  I then incised it under direct vision dorsal to its axis and incised it both proximally and distally.  The EPB subsheath was likewise released.,I irrigated the wound thoroughly.  In order to prevent tendon subluxation, I then back-cut both the dorsal and volar leafs of the sheath so that I could close them in an extended and lengthened position.  I did this with 3-0 Vicryl.  I then passed an instrument underneath to check and make sure that the sheath was not too tight.  I then irrigated it and closed the skin, and then I dressed and splinted the wrist appropriately.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",Orthopedic
4578,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 68-year-old woman whom I have been following, who has had angina.  In any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when I spoke to her.  I advised her to call 911, which she did.  While waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain.  By the time she presented here, she is currently pain-free and is feeling well.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , The patient has been having arm pain for several months.  She underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia.  I had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker.  However, her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room.  On 08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80%  mid LAD lesion, circumflex normal, and RCA totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right, as well as right to right to that area.  The decision was made to transfer  her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the LAD stenosis to the RCA vessel.  She underwent that with drug-eluting stents on 08/16/08, with I believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08.  She had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild.  Yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin.  This is her usual angina.  She is being admitted with unstable angina post stent.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Longstanding hypertension, CAD as above, hyperlipidemia, and overactive bladder.,MEDICATIONS:,1.

SHE DENIES ANY SHRIMP OR SEA FOOD ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Her father died of an MI in his 50s and a brother had his first MI and bypass surgery at 54.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, no use of illicit drugs.  She is divorced and lives alone and is a retired laboratory technician from Cornell Diagnostic Laboratory.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting up blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi, cholelithiasis, asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, home oxygen use or sleep apnea, although she has been told in the past that she snores and there was some question of apnea in 05/08.

INR is 0.89, PTT 20.9, white blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 31 and it was 35 on 08/15/08, and platelet count 257,000.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 68-year-old woman with exertional angina, characterized with arm pain, who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery.  In any case, given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free, I am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy.  We will continue her beta-blocker and I cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already.  Aspirin, Plavix, valsartan, Lipitor, and Norvasc.  I am going to add Imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out MI, although there is a little suspicion.  I suppose it is possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect.  My concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal LV function.  She will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis, Claritin for allergies, and Detrol LA for urinary incontinence.,Total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes.  All this was discussed in detail with the patient and her daughter who expressed understanding and agreement.  The patient desires full resuscitation status.",Consult - History and Phy.

The patient underwent a colonoscopy which found this lesion and biopsies were taken proving invasive adenocarcinoma.  The patient was NG decompressed preoperatively and was prepared for surgery.  The need for removal of the colon cancer was explained at length.  The patient was agreeable to proceed with the surgery and signed preoperatively informed consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the Operative Suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per Anesthesia Department and NG and Foley catheters were placed preoperatively.  She was given triple antibiotics IV.  Due to her near obstructive symptoms, a formal ________ was not performed.,The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline laparotomy incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel and subcutaneous tissues were separated with electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal fascia.  Once divided, the intraabdominal cavity was accessed and bowel was protected as the rest of the abdominal wall was opened in the midline.  Extensive fluid was seen upon entering the abdomen, ascites fluid, which was clear straw-colored and this was sampled for cytology.  Next, the small bowel was retracted with digital exploration and there was a evidence of hepatic flexure, colonic mass, which was adherent to the surrounding tissues.  With mobilization of the colon along the line of Toldt down to the right gutter, the entire ileocecal region up to the transverse colon was mobilized into the field.  Next, a window was made 5 inches from the ileocecal valve and a GIA-75 was fired across the ileum.  Next, a second GIA device was fired across the proximal transverse colon, just sparring the middle colic artery.  The dissection was then carried down along the mesentry, down to the root of the mesentry.  Several lymph nodes were sampled carefully, and small radiopaque clips were applied along the base of the mesentry.  The mesentry vessels are hemostated and tied with #0-Vicryl suture sequentially, ligated in between.  Once this specimen was submitted to pathology, the wound was inspected.  There was no evidence of bleeding from any of the suture sites.  Next, a side-by-side anastomosis was performed between the transverse colon and the terminal ileum.  A third GIA-75 was fired side-by-side and GIA-55 was used to close the anastomosis.  A patent anastomosis was palpated.  The anastomosis was then protected with a #2-0 Vicryl #0-muscular suture.  Next, the mesenteric root was closed with a running #0-Vicryl suture to prevent any chance of internal hernia.  The suture sites were inspected and there was no evidence of leakage.  Next, the intraabdominal cavity was thoroughly irrigated with sterile saline and the anastomosis was carried into the right lower gutter.  Omentum was used to cover the intestines which appeared dilated and indurated from the near obstruction.  Next, the abdominal wall was reapproximated and the fascial layer using a two running loop PDS sutures meeting in the middle with good approximation of both the abdominal fascia.  Additional sterile saline was used to irrigate the subcutaneous fat and then the skin was closed with sequential sterile staples.,Sterile dressing was applied and the skin was cleansed and the patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the Operating Room and she was transferred to Recovery Room in stable condition and will be continued to be monitored on the Telemetry Floor with triple antibiotics and NG decompression.,",Gastroenterology

The most recent one which I performed quite a number of years ago that was complicated by a bone flap infection and he has had removal of his bone flap.  He has been without the bone flap for a number of years now but has finally decided that he wanted to proceed with a cranioplasty.  After discussing the risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery, the decision was made to proceed with operative intervention in the form of a cranioplasty.  He had previously undergone a CT scan.  Premanufactured cranioplasty made for him that was sterile and ready to implant.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, an appropriate time out was performed.  We identified the patient, the location of surgery, the appropriate surgical procedure, and the appropriate implant.  He was given intravenous antibiotics with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and Flagyl appropriately for antibiotic prophylaxis and sequential compression devices were used for deep venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.  The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A previous incision was reopened and the scalp flap was reflected forward.  We dissected off the dura and we were able to get a nice plane of dissection elevating the temporalis muscle along with the scalp flap.  We freed up the bony edges circumferentially, but except for the inferior frontal region where the vascularized pericranial graft took its vascular supply from we did not come across the base.  We did explore laterally and saw a little bit of the mesh on the lateral orbit.  Once we had the bony edges explored, we took the performed plate and secured it in a place with titanium plates and screws.  We had achieved good hemostasis.  The wound was closed in multiple layers in usual fashion over a Blake drain.  At the end of the procedure, all sponge and needle counts were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the incision.

The patient states that he has had degenerative joint disease in his left first MPJ for many years that has been progressively getting worse and more painful over time.  The patient desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 7 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo-type block.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered to the operating table, the stockinet was reflected, and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.,Attention was then directed to the left first metatarsophalangeal joint.  Approximately a 6 cm dorsomedial incision was created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint, just medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The incision was then deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was undermined medially, off of the joint capsule.  A dorsal linear capsular incision was then made.  Care was taken to identify and preserve the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The capsule and periosteum were then reflected off of the head of the first metatarsal as well as the base of the proximal phalanx.  There was noted to be a significant degenerative joint disease.  There was little to no remaining healthy articular cartilage left on the head of the first metatarsal.  There was significant osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally in the first metatarsal head as well as at the base of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal saw was then used to resect the base of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to ensure that the resection was parallel to the nail.  After the bone was removed in toto, the area was inspected and the flexor tendon was noted to be intact.  The sagittal saw was then used to resect the osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally on the first metatarsal.  The first metatarsal was then re-modelled and smoothed in a more rounded position with a reciprocating rasp.  The sizers were then inserted for the Biopro implant.  A large was noted to be of the best size.  There was noted to be some hypertrophic bone laterally in the base of the proximal phalanx.  Following inspection, the sagittal saw was used to clean both the medial and lateral sides of the base.  A small bar drill was then used to pre-drill for the Biopro sizer.  The bone was noted to be significantly hardened.  The sizer was placed and a large Biopro was deemed to be the correct size implant.  The sizer was removed and bar drill was then again used to ream the medullary canal.  The hand reamer with a Biopro set was then used to complete the process.  The Biopro implant was then inserted and tamped with a hammer and rubber mallet to ensure tight fit.  There was noted to be distally increased range of motion after insertion of the implant.,Attention was then directed to the first metatarsal.  A long dorsal arm Austin osteotomy was then created.  A second osteotomy was then created just plantar and parallel to the first osteotomy site.  The wedge was then removed in toto.  The area was feathered to ensure high compression of the osteotomy site.  The head was noted to be in a more plantar flexed position.  The capital fragment was then temporarily fixated with two 0.45 K-wires.  A 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion.  A second more proximal 2.7 x 60 mm screw was also inserted in a standard AO fashion.  With both screws, there was noted to be tight compression at the osteotomy sites.,The K-wires were removed and the areas were then smoothed with reciprocating rash.  A screw driver was then used to check and ensure screw tightness.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Subchondral drilling was performed with a 1.5 drill bit.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Closure consisted of capsular closure with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl, followed by running subcuticular stitch of #5-0 Vicryl.  Dressings consisted of Steri-Strips, Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  A total of 10 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected intraoperatively for further anesthesia.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.

The symptoms were unrelieved by conservative modalities.  The symptoms were interfering with all aspects of daily living and inability to perform any significant work endeavors.  She is understanding the risks, benefits, potential complications, as well as all treatment alternatives.  She wished to proceed with the aforementioned surgery due to her persistent symptoms.  Informed consent was obtained.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR room #5 where she was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia.  She was subsequently placed on the Jackson spinal table with the Wilson attachment in the prone position.  Palpation did reveal the iliac crest and suspected L5-S1 interspace.  Thereafter the lumbar spine was serially prepped and draped.  A midline incision was carried over the spinal process of L5 to S1.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue were divided sharply.  Electrocautery provided hemostasis.  Electrocautery was then utilized to dissect through the subcutaneous tissues to the lumbar fascia.  Lumbar fascia was identified and the decussation of fibers was identified at the L5-S1 interspace.  On the left side, superior aspect dissection was carried out with the Cobb elevator and electrocautery.  This revealed the interspace of suspect level of L5-S1 on the left.  A Kocher clamp was placed between the spinous processes of the suspect level of L5-S1.  X-ray did confirm the L5-S1 interval.  Angled curet was utilized to detach the ligamentum flavum from its bony attachments at the superior edge of S1 lamina and the inferior edge of the L5 lamina.  Meticulous dissection was undertaken and the ligamentum flavum was removed.  Laminotomy was created with Kerrison rongeur, both proximally and distally.  The microscope was positioned and the dura was inspected.  A blunt Penfield elevator was then utilized to dissect and identify the L5-S1 nerve root on the left.  It was noted to be tented over a disc extrusion.  The nerve root was protected and medialized.  It was retracted with a nerve root retractor.  This did reveal a subligamentous disc herniation at approximately the L5-S1 disc space and neuroforaminal area.  A #15 Bard-Parker blade was utilized to create an annulotomy.  Medially, disc material was extruding through this annulotomy.  Two tier rongeur was then utilized to grasp the disc material and the disc was removed from the interspace.  Additional disc material was then removed, both to the right and left of the annulotomy.  Up and downbiting pituitary rongeurs were utilized to remove any other loose disc pieces.  Once this was completed, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  The Penfield elevator was placed in the disc space of L5-S1 and a crosstable x-ray did confirm this level.  Nerve root was again expected exhibiting the foramina.  A foraminotomy was created with a Kerrison rongeur.  Once this was created, the nerve root was again inspected and deemed free of tension.  It was mobile within the neural foramina.  The wound was again copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  A free fat graft was then harvested from the subcutaneous tissues and placed over the exposed dura.  Lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl interrupted fashion, subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, and #4-0 undyed Vicryl was utilized to approximate the skin.  Compression dressing was applied.  The patient was turned, awoken, and noted to be moving all four extremities without apparent deficits.  She was taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded due to her ongoing pain syndrome that has been requiring significant narcotic medications.",Neurosurgery

Rheumatoid arthritis.,4.  Suspected mild stress-induced adrenal insufficiency.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission.  She was seen on multiple occasions at Urgent Care and in her physician's office.  Initial x-ray showed some mild diffuse patchy infiltrates.  She was first started on Avelox, but had a reaction, switched to Augmentin, which caused loose stools, and then three days prior to admission was given daily 1 g Rocephin and started on azithromycin.  Her O2 saturations drifted downward.  They were less than 88% when active; at rest, varied between 88% and 92%.  Decision was made because of failed outpatient treatment of pneumonia.  Her medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis.  She is on 20 mg of methotrexate every week as well as Remicade every eight weeks.  Her last dose of Remicade was in the month of June.  Hospital course was relatively unremarkable.  CT scan was performed and no specific focal pathology was seen.  Dr. X, pulmonologist was consulted.  He also was uncertain as to the exact etiology, but viral etiology was most highly suspected.  Because of her loose stools, C. difficile toxin was ordered, although that is pending at the time of discharge.  She was continued on Rocephin IV and azithromycin.  Her fever broke 18 hours prior to discharge, and O2 saturations improved, as did her overall strength and clinical status.  She was instructed to finish azithromycin.  She has two pills left at home.  She is to follow up with Dr. X in two to three days.  Because she is on chronic prednisone therapy, it was suspected that she was mildly adrenal insufficient from the stress of her pneumonia.  She is to continue the increased dose of prednisone at 20 mg (up from 5 mg per day).  We will consult her rheumatologist as to whether to continue her methotrexate, which we held this past Friday.  Methotrexate is known on some occasions to cause pneumonitis.",Discharge Summary

1927,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Followup of laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a delightful baby girl, who is now nearly 8 months of age and had a tracheostomy for subglottic stenosis.  Laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy was done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty.  Dr. X is following The patient for this and currently plans are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of months to assist the status of her airway caliber.,The patient had a laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy on 10/05/2007.  She has done well since that time.  She has had some episodes of retching intermittently and these seemed to be unpredictable.  She also had some diarrhea and poor feeding tolerance about a week ago but that has also resolved.  The patient currently takes about 1 ounce to 1.5 ounce of her feedings by mouth and the rest is given by G-tube.  She seems otherwise happy and is not having an excessive amount of stools.  Her parents have not noted any significant problems with the gastrostomy site.,The patient's exam today is excellent.  Her belly is soft and nontender.  All of her laparoscopic trocar sites are healing with a normal amount of induration, but there is no evidence of hernia or infection.  We removed The patient's gastrostomy button today and showed her parents how to reinsert one without difficulty.  The site of the gastrostomy is excellent.  There is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema, and I am very happy with the overall appearance.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy.  Hopefully, the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal, and if she does well, allow decannulation in the future.  If she does require laryngotracheoplasty, the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure as well.,PLAN:  ,The patient will follow up as needed for problems related to gastrostomy.  We will see her when she comes in the hospital for endoscopic exams and possibly laryngotracheoplasty in the future.",Pediatrics - Neonatal

Intraoperative monitoring with EMGs and SSEPs.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 350 cc.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,COUNTS: , Correct.,SPECIMENS SENT:  ,None.,CLINICAL HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted through the emergency room for progressive weakness and falling.  He was worked by the neurologist, Dr. X, and found to have cervical spondylosis with myelopathy.  I was consulted and elected to do a lumbar and cervical myelogram CT scan, which showed lumbar stenosis but also cervical stenosis with more pathology anteriorly than posteriorly.  The patient had worst disease at level C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.  The patient was significantly weak and almost quadriparetic, stronger on the right side than on the left side.  I thought that surgery was indicated to prevent progressive neurological deterioration, as well as to prevent a central cord syndrome if the patient were to get into a motor vehicle accident or simply fall.  Conservative management was not an option.  The patient was preoped and consented, and was medically cleared.  I discussed the indications, risks, and benefits of the surgery with the patient and the patient's family.  The risks of bleeding, hoarseness, swallowing difficulty, pseudoarthrosis as well as plate migration and hardware failure were all discussed with the patient.  An informed consent was obtained from the patient as such.  He was brought into the OR today for the operative procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the OR, intubated, and given a general anesthetic.  Intubation was done under C-spine precautions.  The patient received preoperative vancomycin and Decadron.  He was hooked up to the SSEP apparatus and had poor baselines and delays.,With a large a shoulder roll, I extended the patient's neck, and landmark incision in crease in the right upper neck, and the area was then prepped and sterilely draped.  All the lines had been put in and the arms were padded.,Using a knife and cautery, I took the incision down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and arrived at the cervical spine.  Prominent osteophyte at C5-C6 was noted, lesser at C4-C5.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed our levels, and we were fully exposed from C3-C6.,Trimline retractors were put in, and I cut the discs out as well as removed the superficial hyperstatic bone and osteophytes.,With the drill, I performed a superficial discectomy and endplate resection, curetting the endplate as I went.  I then brought in the microscope, under the microscopic guidance, firmly removed the end plates and drilled through the posterior longitudinal ligament to decompress the spinal cord.  Worst findings at C3-C4 followed C5-C6 and then C4-C5.  Excellent thecal sac decompression was achieved and foraminal decompression was also achieved.  With change in intraoperative monitoring, a microscope was used for this decompressive procedure.,The patient was very oozy throughout this procedure, and during the decompression part, the oozing was constant.  This was partly due to the patient's cancellous bone, but he had been on aspirin which was stopped only 2 days ago, and the option was not available to wait 2 to 3 weeks which would have made this man worse simply over time.  I thus elected to give him DDAVP, platelets, and used Horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis.  This took literally half-an-hour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case.  Eventually, with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameters under control, bleeding was somewhat slow.,I then selected two 10 and one 9-mm cadaveric allograft, which had soaking in bacitracin solution.  These were trimmed to the desired dimensions, and under slight distraction, these were tapped into position.  Excellent graft alignment was achieved.,I now brought in a DePuy titanium eagle plate, and I fixed it to the spine from C3 to C6.  Fourteen millimeter screws were used; all the screws were tightened and torqued.  The patient's bone quality was poor, but the screws did torque appropriately.  I inspected the plate, controlled the hemostasis, assessed post-fixation x-ray, and was really happy with the screw length and the overall alignment.,The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution; a Jackson-Pratt drain 10-French was put in with trocar.  Decision was made to start the closure.  So, I closed the platysma with 3-0 Vicryl and used staples for the skin.  A simple Primapore or Medpore dressing was applied.  The patient was extubated in the OR and taken to the PSU in stable medical condition.,When I saw the patient in the ICU, he was awake, alert, and moving all four extremities, somewhat weak on the left side.  He had done well from the surgery.  Blood loss was 350 cc.  All instrument, needle, and sponge counts were correct.  No complications, no change in intraoperative monitoring.  No specimens were sent.,The patient's wife was spoken to and fully appraised of the intraoperative findings and the expected prognosis.  The patient will be kept n.p.o. tonight and will gradually advance his diet, and also will gradually advance his activity.  I will keep him on Decadron and keep the collar on.  I do not think there is need for halo rest.  We will be obtaining formal C-spine films in the morning.  Prognosis is guarded but favorable at this time.",Neurosurgery

The patient is also diabetic.  The patient had a workup for her gallbladder, which showed evidence of biliary dyskinesia.  The patient was then scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic and biliary dyskinesia.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient's abdomen was explored.  There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding or masses.  The abdomen was otherwise within normal limits.  The gallbladder was easily visualized.  There was an intrahepatic gallbladder.  There was no evidence of any inflammatory change.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought into the operating suite.,After general endotracheal intubation, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Next, an infraumbilical incision was made with a #10 scalpel.  The skin was elevated with towel clips and a Veress needle was inserted.  The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg of pressure.  The Veress needle was removed and a #10 blade trocar was inserted without difficulty.  The laparoscope was then inserted through this #10 port and the abdomen was explored.  There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding.  The peritoneum was smooth.  The gallbladder was intrahepatic somewhat.  No evidence of any inflammatory change.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the abdomen.  Next, attention was made to placing the epigastric #10 port, which again was placed under direct visualization without difficulty.  The two #5 ports were placed, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior axillary line again in similar fashion under direct visualization.  The gallbladder was then grasped out at its fundus, elevated to patient's left shoulder.  Using a curved dissector, the cystic duct was identified and freed up circumferentially.  Next, an Endoclip was used to distal and proximal to the gallbladder, Endoshears were used in between to transect the cystic duct.  The cystic artery was transected in similar fashion.  Attention was next made in removing the gallbladder from the liver bed using electrobovie cautery and spatulated tip.  It was done without difficulty.  The gallbladder was then grasped via the epigastric port and removed without difficulty and sent to pathology.  Hemostasis was maintained using electrobovie cautery.  The liver bed was then copiously irrigated and aspirated.  All the fluid and air was then aspirated and then all ports were removed under direct visualization.  The two #10 ports were then closed in the fascia with #0 Vicryl and a UR6 needle.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  0.25% Marcaine was injected and Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Recovery in stable condition.",Surgery

He now presents with significant upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction and is unable to tolerate a CPAP machine.  Therefore, for repair of the above-mentioned deformities including the internal and external nasal valve collapse as well as straightening of the deviated septum, the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with him included but not limited to bleeding, infection, septal perforation, need for further surgeries, external deformity, and he desired to proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and laid supine upon the OR table.  After the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the nose was decongested using Afrin-soaked pledgets followed by the injection of % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial planes bilaterally.  Examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction as well as the large septal spur along the floor.  The caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position.  There was evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right nares and it was decided to leave this in place.  Following the evaluation of the nose, a hemitransfixion incision was made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side.  Very carefully, the mucoperichondrial flaps were elevated over this, and it was excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine.  Very carefully, the bony cartilaginous junction was identified and a small piece of the bone, where the spur was, was carefully removed.  Following this, it was noted that the cartilaginous region was satisfactory in quantity as well as quality to perform adequate grafting procedures.  Therefore, attention was turned to harvesting the right-sided auricular cartilage, which was done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Postauricular incision using a #15 blade, the area of the submucoperichondrial plane was elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all times.  This was very carefully harvested.  This area had been injected previously with 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine.  Following this, the cartilage was removed.  It was placed in saline, noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft as well as a small piece of crush which was used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity.  The spreader grafts were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets.  After an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed, adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilages rather from his previous surgery.  These were secured in place in the pockets using a 5-0 PDS suture in a mattress fashion in two places.  Following this, attention was turned to placing the alar rim grafts where pockets were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin.  Subsequently, the alar rim grafts were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture.  This was sutured in place using a 5-0 self-absorbing gut suture.  The lower lateral cartilage has had some inherent asymmetry.  This may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome; however, this was left in place as he did not desire any changes in the tip region, and there was adequate support.  An endodermal suture was placed just to reenforce the region using a 5-0 PDS suture.  Following all this, the area was closed using a mattress 4-0 plain gut on a Keith needle followed by the application of ***** 5-0 fast-absorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision.  Very carefully, the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelopes were reflected.  The curvilinear incision was closed using a Vicryl followed by interrupted 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The marginal incisions were then closed using 5-0 fast-absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed and secured down using a nylon suture.  They had ointment also placed on them.  Following this, nasopharynx was suctioned.  There were no further abnormalities noted and everything appeared to be in nice position.  Therefore, an external splint was placed after the application of Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened in the operating room.  He was extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",ENT - Otolaryngology

The right frontal area was shaven and then the head was prepped and draped in a standard routine manner.  The area of the proposed scalp incision was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  A curvilinear scalp incision was made extending from just posterior to bregma curving up in the midline and then going off to the right anterior to the coronal suture.  Two Weitlaner were used to hold the scalp open.  A burr hole was made just anterior to the coronal suture and then the dura was opened in a cruciate manner and the pia was coagulated.  Neuropen was introduced directly through the parenchyma into the ventricular system, which was quite large and dilated.  CSF was collected for routine studies.  We saw the total absence of __________  consistent with the congenital form of aqueductal stenosis and a markedly thinned down floor of the third ventricle.  I could bend the ventricular catheter and look back and see the aqueduct, which was quite stenotic with a little bit of chorioplexus near its opening.  The NeuroPEN was then introduced through the midline of the floor of the third ventricle anterior to the mamillary bodies in front of the basilar artery and then was gently enlarged using NeuroPEN __________  various motions.  We went through the membrane of Liliequist.  We could see the basilar artery and the clivus, and there was no significant bleeding from the edges.  The Bactiseal catheter was then left to 7 cm of length because of her macrocephaly and secured to a burr hole port with a 2-0 Ethibond suture.

He has received BCG.  The patient is doing well.  The patient was supposed to come to the OR for surveillance biopsy and pyelograms.  The patient had a large left hydrocele, which was increasingly getting worse and was making it very difficult for the patient to sit to void or put clothes on, etc.  Options such as watchful waiting, drainage in the office, and hydrocelectomy were discussed.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, infection in the scrotum, enlargement of the scrotum, recurrence, and pain were discussed.  The patient understood all the options and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.,A transverse scrotal incision was made over the hydrocele sac and the hydrocele fluid was withdrawn.  The sac was turned upside down and sutures were placed.  Careful attention was made to ensure that the cord was open.  The testicle was in normal orientation throughout the entire procedure.  The testicle was placed back into the scrotal sac and was pexed with 4-0 Vicryl to the outside dartos to ensure that there was no risk of torsion.  Orchiopexy was done at 3 different locations.  Hemostasis was obtained using electrocautery.  The sac was closed using 4-0 Vicryl.  The sac was turned upside down so that when it heals, the fluid would not recollect.  The dartos was closed using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl and Dermabond was applied.  Incision measured about 2 cm in size.  Subsequently using ACMI cystoscope, a cystoscopy was performed.  The urethra appeared normal.  There was some scarring at the bulbar urethra, but the scope went in through that area very easily into the bladder.  There was a short prostatic fossa.  The bladder appeared normal.  There was some moderate trabeculation throughout the bladder, some inflammatory changes in the bag part, but nothing of much significance.  There were no papillary tumors or stones inside the bladder.  Bilateral pyelograms were obtained using 8-French cone-tip catheter, which appeared normal.  A cold cup biopsy of the bladder was done and was fulgurated for hemostasis.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was brought to recovery at the end of the procedure after emptying the bladder.,The patient was given antibiotics and was told to take it easy.  No heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling.  Plan was to follow up in about 2 months.",Surgery

Transconjunctival exploration of right orbital floor with release of entrapped periorbita.,3.  Open reduction of nasal septum and nasal pyramid fracture with osteotomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal anesthesia.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in the supine position.  Under affects of general endotracheal anesthesia, head and neck were prepped and draped with pHisoHex solution and draped in the appropriate sterile fashion.  A gull-wing incision was drawn over the forehead scalp.  Hair was removed along the suture line and incision was made to skin and subcutaneous tissue of the scalp down to, but not including the pericranium.  An inferiorly based forehead flap was then elevated to the superior orbital rim.  The depression of the anterior table of the frontal sinus was noted.  An incision was made more posterior creating an inferiorly based pericranial flap.  The supraorbital nerve was axing from the supraorbital foramen and the supraorbital foramen was converted to a groove in order to allow further inferior displacement and positioning of the forehead flap.  These allowed exposure of the medial orbital wall on the right side.  The displaced fractures of the right medial orbital wall were repositioned through coronal approach.  ,Further reduction of the nose intranasally also allowed the ethmoid fracture to be aligned more appropriately in the medial wall.  The anterior table fracture was satisfactorily reduced.  Multiple 1.3-mm screws and plate fixation were utilized to recontour the anterior forehead.  A mucocele was removed from the frontal sinus and there was no significant destruction of the posterior wall.  A sinus seeker was utilized and passed into the nasofrontal duct without difficulty.  It was felt that the frontal sinus obliteration would not be necessary.,At this point, the pericranial flap was folded in a fan-folded fashion on top of the plate and screw and hardware and fixed in position with the sutures to remain better contour of the forehead.  At this point, the nose was significantly shifted to the left and an open reduction of the nasal fracture was performed by osteotomies, which were made medially, laterally, and percutaneous transverse osteotomy of the nasal bone on the right side.  There is significant depression of the nasal bone on the left side.  A medial osteotomy was performed on the left side mobilizing nasal pyramid satisfactorily.  There is a high septal deviation, which would not allow complete correction of the deviation.  It was felt that this would best be left for a later date.  Open reduction rhinoplasty could be performed with spread of cartilage grafting in order to straighten the septum high dorsally.  Local infiltration anesthesia 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in the conjunctival fornix of the right lower eyelid as well as the inferior orbital rim.  An incision was made in the palpebral conjunctiva and capsular palpebral fascia beneath the tarsal plate preseptal approach to the inferior orbital rim was performed in this fashion.  Dissection proceeded down to the inferior orbital rim and subperiosteal dissection was performed over the orbital floor.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  There was entrapped periorbita, which was released to the fractures, which were repositioned, but not fixed in position.  The forced ductions were performed, which demonstrated release of the periorbit satisfactorily.  The conjunctival incision was closed with an interrupted simple 6-0 plain gut suture.  The nasal pyramid was satisfactorily mobilized as well as the nasal septum and brought back to midline position with the help of a Boies elevator for the septum.  The coronal incision was closed with interrupted 3-0 PDS suture for the galea and deep subcutaneous tissue and the skin closed with interrupted surgical staples.  Nose was dressed with Steri-Strips.  Mastisol Orthoplast splint was prepared after the Doyle splints were placed in the nose and secured with 3-0 Prolene suture and the nose packed with two Kennedy Merocel sponges.  A supportive mildly compressive dressing with fluffs, Kerlix, and 4-inch Ace were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition.",ENT - Otolaryngology

1442,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 62-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for carbohydrate counting for type I diabetes.  The patient reports that she was hospitalized over the weekend for DKA.  She indicates that her blood sugar on Friday night was 187 at bedtime and that when she woke up in the morning her blood sugar was 477.  She gave herself, in smaller increments, a total of 70 extra units of her Humalog.  Ten of those units were injectable; the others were in the forms of pump.  Her blood sugar was over 600 when she went to the hospital later that day.  She is here at this consultation complaining of not feeling well still because she has a cold.  She realizes that this is likely because her immune system was so minimized in the hospital.,OBJECTIVE:,  Current insulin doses on her insulin pump are boluses set at 5 units at breakfast, 6 units at lunch and 11 units at supper.  Her basal rates have not been changed since her last visit with Charla Yassine and totaled 30.5 units per 24 hours.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on carbohydrate counting at 1 unit of insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate ratio was recommended.  A correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring the blood sugars down 30 mg/dl was also recommended.  The Lilly guide for meal planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional carbohydrate counting book was provided.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient was taught an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 g of carbohydrates as recommended at the previous visit two years ago, which she does not recall.  It is based on the 500 rule which suggests this ratio.  We did identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing 15-g equivalents.  We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources.  She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated.  We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.  With this in mind, she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner.  Joanne Araiza joined our consultation briefly to discuss whether her pump was working appropriately.  The patient was given an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient use 1 unit of insulin for every 10-g carbohydrate load consumed.  Recommend the patient either use this as a carbohydrate counting tool or work harder at keeping carbohydrate content consistent at meals from day to day.  This was a one-hour consultation.  Provided my name and number should additional needs arise.",SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes
635,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,PROCEDURE:  ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 3 other trocars were placed.  The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position.  The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior iliac spine.  The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.,The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left.  The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder.  A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free.,A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct proximally and distally.  The duct was divided between the clips.  The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct.  The cystic artery was found medially and slightly posterior to the cystic duct.  It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues.  A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally.  The artery was divided between the clips.  The 2 midline port sites were injected with 5% Marcaine.,After the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula.  The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula.  As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen.  The neck of the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen.  Following gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen.,Both midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture.  All skin incisions were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  Dressings were applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.",Surgery

The neck was placed in a flexed position.  The patient was monitored with blood pressure cuff, EKG, and pulse oximetry and given oxygen via nasal cannula.  The patient was lightly sedated.  The skin was prepped and draped in a sterile classical fashion.,Under fluoroscopy control, the waists of the articular pillars were identified and marked.  Local anesthesia infiltrated subcutaneously and deep extending down toward these previously marked points.  Once the anesthesia was established, an insulated 10-cm, 22-gauge needle with a 5-mm non-insulated stimulating tip was placed in contact with the waists of the articular pillars at the affected levels that were previously mentioned.  This was done under direct fluoroscopic control utilizing a gun barrel technique with PA views initially for orientation and then a lateral view to determine the depth of the needle.  For C3 to C6 medial branch RFTC's, the needles are placed along the ventral aspect of a line that connects the greatest antero-posterior diameter of the articular pillar but remains dorsal to the foramen as seen on lateral imaging.  For a C7 medial branch RFTC, the needle tip is positioned more superiorly such that it overlies the superior articular process.  For a C8 medial branch RFTC, the needle is placed at the junction of the superior articulating facet and the base of the transverse process of T1.,Sensory stimulation was carried out at 50 Hz from 0 to 2.0 volts.  Stimulation was stopped once the maximum voltage was delivered or the patient either described a buzzing sensation indicating that it was a nonpainful nerve, or it caused replication of their concordant pain.  The stimulation was then changed to 2 Hz for motor stimulation and advanced up to 2.0 volts or until motor stimulation was found at that level.  If motor stimulation occurred, the needle was repositioned to abolish it but still cause concordant pain, or the RFTC was aborted at this level.,If the sensory stimulation caused concordant pain without motor stimulation, the area was then anesthetized with 1 cc of Marcaine 0.5% with 5 mg of methyl prednisolone acetate.  Once the anesthesia was established, a radiofrequency lesioning was then done at 65 degrees for 60 seconds.  The same procedure was carried out at all the affected levels.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any difficulties or complications.",Pain Management

The hymen was found to be intact.  Laparoscopic findings revealed a 4 cm left adnexal mass, which appeared fluid filled.  There were a few calcifications on the surface of the mass.  The right ovary and fallopian tube appeared normal.  There was no evidence of endometriosis.  The uterus appeared normal in size.  There were no pelvic adhesions noted.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gravida 0, para 0 Caucasian female who presents with a left adnexal mass on ultrasound which is 5.3 cm.  She does complain of minimal discomfort.  Bimanual exam was not able to be performed secondary to the vaginal stenosis and completely intact hymen.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the Operative Suite, prepped and draped, and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A 1 cm skin incision was made in the infraumbilical vault.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty and the abdomen was insufflated.  This was done using appropriate flow and volume of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was then placed without difficulty.  The above findings were confirmed.  A #12 mm port was then placed approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis under direct visualization.  Two additional ports were placed, one on the left lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and one on the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall.  Both #12 step ports were done under direct visualization.  Using a grasper, the mass was tented up at the inferior pelvic ligament and the LigaSure was placed across this and several bites were taken with good visualization while ligating.  The left ovary was then placed in an Endocatch bag and removed through the suprapubic incision.  The skin was extended around this incision and the fascia was extended using the Mayo scissors.  The specimen was removed intact in the Endocatch bag through this site.  Prior to desufflation of the abdomen, the site where the left adnexa was removed was visualized to be hemostatic.  All the port sites were hemostatic as well.  The fascia of the suprapubic incision was then repaired using a running #0 Vicryl stitch on a UR6 needle.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The remaining incisions were also closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running fashion after all instruments were removed and the abdomen was completely desufflated.  Steri-Strips were placed on each of the incisions.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle count were x2.  She will go home on Vicodin for pain and followup postoperatively in the office where we will review path report with her.",Surgery

She was then transferred to Beaumont Hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess.  The patient was treated for the abscess in Beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in Warren, Michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.,The patient subsequently recovered in a Cardiac Rehab Facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of August, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an MRI, which showed record signal change.  The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement.  Approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today's date, the health officer was notified of the patient's labored breathing.  When she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities.  She was concerned and called the Orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic.  I was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma.  On clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck.  The patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups.  Reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities.  Long track signs are absent.  Sensory level is at the C4 dermatome.  Rectal tone is absent.  I discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter.  We discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery.  They are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #1 at ABCD General Hospital on a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic.  A Foley catheter was placed in the bladder.  The patient was log rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  The patient's head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder.  At this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previous skin incision was reopened.  At this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound.  All sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time.  The self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound.  Consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound.  Next, the epidural space was encountered.  There was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.  A curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac.  The inferior edge of the C2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well.  Next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe.  The walls of the wound were explored.  There was no active bleeding.  Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding.  A #19 French Hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.  Fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision.  The patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.  She remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  Once in the recovery room, she was alert.  She was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities.

Oxygenation was given.  The patient's oxygenation and vital signs were closely followed to ensure the safety of the administration of the drugs.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.  The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the abdomen to reduce the natural lumbar lordosis.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the boney landmarks of the spine and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.  With fluoroscopy, a Teflon coated needle, ***, was gently guided into the region of the Medial Branch nerves from the Dorsal Ramus of ***.  Specifically, each needle tip was inserted to the bone at the groove between the transverse process and superior articular process on lumbar vertebra, or for sacral vertebrae at the lateral-superior border of the posterior sacral foramen.  Needle localization was confirmed with AP and lateral radiographs.,The following technique was used to confirm placement at the Medial Branch nerves.  Sensory stimulation was applied to each level at 50 Hz; paresthesias were noted at,*** volts.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration; corresponding paraspinal muscle twitching without extremity movement was noted at *** volts.,Following this, the needle Trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 1cc 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the Medial Branch nerve and surrounding tissue.

Both groins were draped and sterilized in the usual fashion.  Local anesthesia was achieved with 2% lidocaine to the right groin area and a #6-French femoral sheath was inserted via modified Seldinger technique in the right common femoral artery.  Selective coronary angiography was performed with #6 French JL4 catheter for the left coronary system and a #6 French JR4 catheter of the right coronary artery.  Left ventricular catheterization and angiography was performed at the end of the procedure with a #6-French angle pigtail catheter.,FINDINGS,1.  Hemodynamics systemic blood pressure 140/70 mmHg.  LVEDP at the end of the procedure was 13 mmHg.,2.  The left main coronary artery is a large with mild diffuse disease in the distal third resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis at the take off of the left circumflex artery.  The left circumflex artery is a large caliber vessel with diffuse disease in the ostium of the proximal segment resulting in less than 30% angiographic stenosis.  The left circumflex artery gives rise to a high small obtuse marginal branch that has high moderate-to-severe ostium.  The rest of the left circumflex artery has mild diffuse disease and it gives rise to a second large obtuse marginal branch that bifurcates into an upper and lower trunk.,The LAD is calcified and diffusely disease in the proximal and mid portion.  There is mild nonobstructive disease in the proximal LAD resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis.,3.  The right coronary artery is dominant.  It is septal to be occluded in the mid portion.,The findings were discussed with the patient and she opted for PCI.  Angiomax bolus was started.  The ACT was checked.  It was higher in 300.  I have given the patient 600 mg of oral Plavix.,The right coronary artery was engaged using a #6-French JR4 guide catheter.  I was unable to cross through this lesion using a BMW wire and a 3.0x8 mm balloon support.  I was unable to cross with this lesion using a whisper wire.  I was unable to cross with this lesion using Cross-IT 100 wire.  I have also used second #6-French Amplatz right I guide catheter.  At one time, I have lost flow in the distal vessel.  The patient experienced severe chest pain, ST-segment elevation, bradycardia, and hypotension, which responded to intravenous fluids and atropine along with intravenous dopamine.,Dr. X was notified.,Eventually, an Asahi grand slam wire using the same 3.0 x 8 mm Voyager balloon support, I was able to cross into the distal vessel.  I have performed careful balloon angioplasty of the mid RCA.  I have given nitroglycerin under the nursing several times during the procedure.,I then performed arthrectomy using #5-French export catheter.,I performed more balloon predilation using a 3.0 x16 mm Voyager balloon.  I then deployed 4.0 x15 mm, excised, and across the mid RCA at 18 atmospheres with good angiographic result.  Proximal to the proximal edge of the stent, there was still some persistent haziness most likely just diseased artery/diffuse plaquing.  I decided to cover this segment using a second 4.0 x 15 mm, excised, and two stents were overlapped, the overlap was postdilated using the same stent delivery balloon at high pressure with excellent angiographic result.,Left ventricular catheterization was performed with #6-French angle pigtail catheter.  The left ventricle is rather smaller in size.  The mid inferior wall is minimally hypokinetic, ejection fraction is 70%.  There is no evidence of aortic wall stenosis or mitral regurgitation.,Femoral angiography revealed that the entry point was above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery and I have performed this as Perclose hemostasis.,CONCLUSIONS,1.  Normal left ventricular size and function.  Ejection fraction is 65% to 70%.  No MR.,2.  Successful angioplasty and stenting of the subtotally closed mid RCA.  This was hard, organized thrombus, very difficult to penetrate.  I have deployed two overlapping 4.0 x15 mm excised and with excellent angiographic result.  The RCA is dominant.,3.  No moderate disease in the distal left main.  Moderate disease in the ostium of the left circumflex artery.  Mild disease in the proximal LAD.,PLAN: , Recommend smoking cessation.

She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.,OBJECTIVE:,  Today's weight:  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following:  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied.  A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:,  The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.  If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly.  This was a one-hour consultation.

3531,"PROCEDURE: , Gastroscopy.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Gastroesophageal reflux disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Barrett esophagus.,MEDICATIONS: , MAC.,PROCEDURE: , The Olympus gastroscope was introduced into the oropharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to the transverse duodenum.  The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen.  The hypopharynx appeared normal.  The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout its distance, but at the distal end, there was a moderate-sized hiatal hernia noted.  The GE junction was seen at 40 cm and the hiatus was noted at 44 cm from the incisors.  Above the GE junction, there were three fingers of columnar epithelium extending cephalad, to a distance of about 2 cm.  This appears to be consistent with Barrett esophagus.  Multiple biopsies were taken from numerous areas in this region.  There was no active ulceration or inflammation and no stricture.  The hiatal hernia sac had normal mucosa except for one small erosion at the hiatus.  The gastric body had normal mucosa throughout.  Numerous small fundic gland polyps were noted, measuring 3 to 5 mm in size with an entirely benign appearance.  Biopsies were taken from the antrum to rule out Helicobacter pylori.  A retroflex view of the cardia and fundus confirmed the small hiatal hernia and demonstrated no additional lesions.  The scope was passed through the pylorus, which was patent and normal.  The mucosa throughout the duodenum in the first, second, and third portions was entirely normal.  The scope was withdrawn and the patient was sent to the recovery room.

Department of Anesthesia administered a spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An Esmarch was applied and a tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg on the left thigh.  A longitudinal incision was made over the anterior portion of the knee and this was taken down through the subcutaneous tissue to the level of the patella retinaculum.  A medial peripatellar arthrotomy was then made and taken down to the level of the tibial tubercle.  Care was then ensured that the patellar tendon was not violated.  The proximal tibia was then skeletonized both medially and laterally to the level of the axis through the joint line.  Again care was ensured that the patellar tendon was not avulsed from the insertion on the tibia.  The intramedullary canal was then opened using a drill and the anterior sizing guide was then placed.  Rongeur was used to take out any osteophytes and the size of approximately size E. At this point, the epicondyle axis guide was then inserted and aligned in a proper orientation.  The anterior cutting guide was then placed.  Care was checked for the amount of resection that the femur would be notched and the oscillating saw was used to cut the anterior portion of the femur.  After this was performed, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed.  The left knee placed in 5 degrees of valgus, guide was then placed, and a standard distal cut was then taken.  After the cuts were ensured further to be leveled and they were, and we proceeded to place the finishing guide size E and distal femur.  This was placed slightly in lateral position and secured in position with spring tense and head lift tense.  Once adequately secured and placed in the appropriate orientation, the alignment was again verified with the epicondyle axis and appeared to be externally rotated appropriately.  The chamfer cuts and anterior and posterior cuts were then made as well as the notch cut using the reciprocating and oscillating saws.  After this was performed, the guide was removed and all bony fragments were then removed.  Attention was then directed to the tibia.  The external tibial alignment guide was then placed and pinned to the proximal tibia in a proper position.  Care was ensured if it is was a varus or valgus and the appropriate.  The femur gauge was then used to provide us appropriate amount of bony resection.  This was then pinned and secured into place.  Ligament retractors were used to protect the collateral ligaments and the tip proximal tibial cut was then made.  This bony portion was then removed and remaining meniscal fragments were removed as well as the ACL till adequate exposure was obtained.  Trial components were then inserted into position and taken the range of motion and found to have good and full excellent range of motion stability.  The trial components were then removed.  The tibia was then stemmed in standard fashion after the tibial plate was placed in some degree of external rotation with appropriate alignment.  After it was stemmed and broached, these were removed and the patella was then incised, a size 41 patella reamer blade was then used and was taken down, a size 38 patella button was then placed intact.  Again the trial components were placed back into position.  Patella button was placed and the tracking was evaluated.  They tracked centrally with no touch technique.  Again, all components were now removed and the knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Once adequately suctioned dry, the tibial portion was cemented and packed into place.  Also excess cement was removed.  The femoral component was then cemented into position.  All excess cement was removed.  A size 12 poly was then inserted in trial to provide compression at cement adhered.  The patella was then cemented and held into place.  All components were held under compression until cement had adequately adhered all excess cement was then removed.  The knee was then taken through range of motion and size 12 felt to be slightly too big, this was removed and the size 10 trial was replaced, and again had excellent varus and valgus stability with full range of motion and felt to be the articulate surface of choice.  The knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  One last check in the posterior aspect of the knee for any loose bony fragments or osteophytes was performed, there were none found and a final articulating surface was impacted and locked into place.  After this, the knee was taken again for final range of motion and found to have excellent position, stability, and good alignment of the components.  The knee was once again copiously irrigated, and the tourniquet was deflated.  Bovie cautery was used to cauterize the knee bleeding that was seen until good hemostasis obtained.  A drain was then placed deep to the retinaculum and the retinaculum repair was performed using #2-0 Ethibond and oversewn with a #1 Vicryl.  This was flexed and the repair was found held securely.  At this point, the knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was approximated with skin staples.  Sterile dressing with Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Kerlix rolls was then applied.  The patient was then transferred back to the gurney in a supine position.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated well with no complications, to PACU in satisfactory condition.",Surgery

The fluid size tends to fluctuate with time but has been relatively persistent for the past year.  I met with the patient's mom and also spoke with his father by phone in the past couple of months and explained the diagnosis of patent processus vaginalis for communicating hydrocele and talked to them about the surgical treatment and options.  All their questions have been answered and the patient is fit for operation today.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient had a very thin patent processus vaginalis leading to a rather sizeable hydrocele sac in the left hemiscrotum.  We probably drained around 10 to 15 mL of fluid from the hydrocele sac.  The processus vaginalis was clearly seen back to the peritoneal reflection where a high ligation was successfully performed.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the inguinal scrotal region.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of inhalation anesthetic.  A peripheral IV was placed, and we conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of The patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were indeed going to perform a left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair.  After preparation and draping was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution, a local infiltration block as well as an ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine.  A curvilinear incision was made low in the left inguinal area along one of prominent skin folds.  Soft tissue dissection was carried down through Scarpa's layer to the external oblique fascia, which was then opened to expose the underlying spermatic cord structures.  The processus vaginalis was dissected free from the spermatic cord structures, and the distal hydrocele sac was widely opened and drained of its fluid contents.  The processus vaginalis was cleared back to peritoneal reflection at the deep inguinal ring and a high ligation was performed there using both the transfixing and a mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  After the excess hydrocele and processus vaginalis tissue was excised, the spermatic cord structures were replaced and the external oblique and Scarpa's layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for the final skin closure.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition.  Blood loss was minimal.  No specimen was submitted.,",Pediatrics - Neonatal

She has previously been under the care of Dr. Ninan Matthew in the 1990s and takes Maxalt on a weekly basis and nadolol, omeprazole and amitriptyline for treatment of her migraines, which occur about once a week.  She is under the care of Dr. Bonaparte for hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism.  She has a long history of back and neck pain with multiple injuries in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  In 2000, she developed ""sciatica"" mostly in her right lower extremity.,She is seen today with no outside imaging, except with MRI of her cervical spine and lumbar spine dated February of 2004.  Her cervical MRI reveals an 8 mm central spinal canal at C6-7, multilevel foraminal stenosis, though her report is not complete as we do not have all the pages.  Her lumbar MRI reveals lumbar spinal stenosis at L4-5 with multilevel facet arthropathy and spondylitic changes.,The patient has essentially three major pain complaints.,Her first pain complaint is one of a long history of axial neck pain without particular radicular symptoms.  She complains of popping, clicking, grinding and occasional stiffness in her neck, as well as occasional periscapular pain and upper trapezius myofascial pain and spasms with occasional cervicalgic headaches.  She has been told by Dr. Megahed in the past that she is not considered a surgical candidate.  She has done physical therapy twice as recently as three years ago for treatment of her symptoms.  She complains of occasional pain and stiffness in both hands, but no particular numbness or tingling.,Her next painful complaint is one of midthoracic pain and thoracalgia features with some right-sided rib pain in a non-dermatomal distribution.

1643,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 34-year-old right-handed female who states her symptoms first started after a motor vehicle accident in September 2005.  She may have had a brief loss of consciousness at the time of the accident since shortly thereafter she had some blurred vision, which lasted about a week and then resolved.  Since that time she has had right low neck pain and left low back pain.  She has been extensively worked up and treated for this.  MRI of the C & T spine and LS spine has been normal.  She has improved significantly, but still complains of pain.  In June of this year she had different symptoms, which she feels are unrelated.  She had some chest pain and feeling of tightness in the left arm and leg and face.  By the next morning she had numbness around her lips on the left side and encompassing the whole left arm and leg.  Symptoms lasted for about two days and then resolved.  However, since that time she has had intermittent numbness in the left hand and leg.  The face numbness has completely resolved.  Symptoms are mild.  She denies any previous similar episodes.  She denies associated dizziness, vision changes incoordination, weakness, change in gait, or change in bowel or bladder function.  There is no associated headache.,Brief examination reveals normal motor examination with no pronator drift and no incoordination.  Normal gait.  Cranial nerves are intact.  Sensory examination reveals normal facial sensation.  She has normal and symmetrical light touch, temperature, and pinprick in the upper extremities.  In the lower extremities she has a feeling of dysesthesia in the lateral aspect of the left calf into the lateral aspect of the left foot.  In this area she has normal light touch and pinprick.  She describes it as a strange unusual sensation.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: , Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the left arm and leg.,NEEDLE EMG: , Needle EMG was performed in the left leg, lumbosacral paraspinal, right tibialis anterior, and right upper thoracic paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle.  It revealed normal insertional activity, no spontaneous activity, and normal motor unit action potential form in all muscles tested.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is normal.  There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy, entrapment neuropathy, plexopathy, or lumbosacral radiculopathy.  EMG was also performed in the right upper thoracic paraspinal where she has experienced a lot of pain since the motor vehicle accident.  This was normal.,Based on her history of sudden onset of left face, arm, and leg weakness as well as a normal EMG and MRI of her spine I am concerned that she had a central event in June of this year.  Symptoms are now very mild, but I have ordered an MRI of the brain with and without contrast and MRA of the head and neck with contrast to further elucidate her symptoms.  Once she has the test done she will phone me and further management will be based on the results.",Radiology

Sutures and staples were removed. The abdomen was opened. The were some very early stage adhesions that were easy to separate. Dissection was carried up toward the upper abdomen where the patient was found to have a stool filled descended colon. This was retracted caudally to expose the stomach. There were a number of adhesions to the stomach. These were carefully dissected to expose initially the closure over the gastrotomy site. Initially this looked like this was leaking but it was actually found to be intact.  The pyloroplasty was identified and also found to be intact with no evidence of leakage. Further dissection up toward the hiatus revealed an abscess collection. This was sent for culture and sensitivity and was aspirated and lavaged. Cavity tracked up toward the hiatus. Stomach itself appeared viable, there was no necrotic sections. Upper apex of the stomach was felt to be viable also. I did not pull the stomach and esophagus down into the abdomen from the mediastinum, but placed a sucker up into the mediastinum where additional turbid fluid was identified. Carefully placed a 10 mm flat Jackson-Pratt drain into the mediastinum through the hiatus to control this area of leakage. Two additional Jackson-Pratt drains were placed essentially through the gastrohepatic omentum. This was the area that most of the drainage had collected in. As I had previously discussed with Dr. Sageman I did not feel that mobilizing the stomach to redo the anastomosis in the chest would be a recoverable situation for the patient. I therefore did not push to visualize any focal areas of the anastomosis with the intent of repair. Once the drains were secured, they were brought out through the anterior abdominal wall and secured with 3-0 silk sutures and secured to bulb suction. The midline fascia was then closed using running #2 Prolene sutures bolstered with retention sutures. Subcutaneous tissue was copiously lavaged and then the skin was closed with loosely approximated staples. Dry gauze dressing was placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well, there were no complications.",Surgery

He has not had any pain since but states that he has had pain in the past, not as long and states there was a twisting sensation.  He has no recent cold or flu, although he had rhinorrhea about 3 weeks ago.  He is on no medications and he is here for evaluation.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  The patient has no known allergies.  He is term delivery via spontaneous vaginal delivery.  He has had no problems or hospitalizations with circumcision.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , He has had no previous surgeries.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  All 14-point review of systems were negative except for the above left testicular pain and the history of possible upper respiratory infection about 2 to 3 weeks ago.,IMMUNIZATIONS: , Up-to-date.,FAMILY HISTORY: , The patient lives at home with both parents who are Spanish speaking.  He is not in school.,MEDICATIONS:,  He is on no medications.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  On physical exam, weight is 15.9 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient is a cooperative little boy.,HEENT:  Normal head and neck exam.  No oral or nasal discharge.,NECK:  Without masses.,CHEST:  Without masses.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIAC:  Without murmurs or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.  No masses or tenderness.  His scrotum did not have any swelling at the present time.  There was only minimal discomfort with palpation at the left inguinal area, but no masses were noted.  No palpable nodules such as appendix testis and no swelling was noted and he had mild epididymal swelling only.  His left testis was slightly harder than the right, but this was not very significant.,EXTREMITIES:  He had full range of motion in all 4 extremities.,SKIN:  Warm, pink, and dry.,NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.,LABORATORY DATA: , Ultrasound was obtained today showing no blood flow or poor blood flow on the left except for increased blood flow to the epididymis on the study done at about 1330 hours, and second one done around 1630 hours was normal flow, possible increased flow on the left.  This is personally reviewed by me.  The right was normal.  No masses were appreciated.  There was some mild change in echotexture on the left on the initial study, which had apparently resolved on the second, but may be due to the technical aspects of the study.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , The patient has a possibly torsion detorsion versus other acute testicular problem.  If the patient has indeed testicular torsion, there is an increased possibility that it may reoccur again, actually within the first 24 to 36 hours and as such is recommended doing a left scrotal exploration with possible detorsion of left testis, possible orchiectomy if the testis is markedly abnormal or nonviable, which probably is not the case, and bilateral testes fixation if the torsion is found.  I discussed the pre and postsurgical care with the parents.  Procedure itself with potential complications, risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery including that the torsion could occur again, although it is less likely after the surgical fixation procedure.  The parents understand and wished to proceed.  We will schedule this later today emergently.",Emergency Room Reports
3515,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.,ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.,OPERATIVE TIME:  Three hours.,ANESTHESIA TIME:  Four hours.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After thorough preoperative evaluation, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position and after placement of upper extremity IV access and radial A-line, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  A Foley catheter was placed and a right internal jugular central line was placed.  The chest, abdomen, both groin, and perineum were prepped widely with Betadine and draped as a sterile field with an Ioban drape.  A long midline incision from xiphoid to pubis was created with a scalpel and the abdomen was carefully entered.  A sterile Omni-Tract was introduced into the field to retract the abdominal wall and gentle exploration of the abdomen was performed.  With the exception of the vascular findings to be described, there were no apparent intra-abdominal abnormalities.,The transverse colon retracted superiorly.  The small bowel was wrapped in moist green towel and retracted in the right upper quadrant.  The posterior peritoneum overlying the aneurysm was scribed mobilizing the ligament of Treitz thoroughly ligating and dividing the inferior mesenteric vein.  Dissection continued superiorly to identify the left renal vein and the right and left inferior renal arteries.  The mid left renal artery was likewise identified.  The perirenal aorta was prepared for clamp superior to the inferior left renal artery.  During this portion of the dissection, the patient was given multiple small doses of intravenous mannitol to establish an osmotic diuresis.  The distal dissection was then completed exposing each common iliac artery.  The arteries were suitable for control.,The patient was then given 8000 units of intravenous sodium heparin and systemic anticoagulation verified by activated clotting time.  The aneurysm was repaired.,First, the common carotid arteries were controlled with atraumatic clamps.  The inferior left renal artery was controlled with a microvascular clamp and a straight aortic clamp was used to control the aorta superior to this renal artery.  The aneurysm was opened on the right anterior lateral aspect and an endarterectomy of the aneurysm sac was performed.  There was a high-grade stenosis at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery and an eversion endarterectomy was performed at this site.  The vessel was controlled with a microvascular clamp.  Two pairs of lumbar arteries were oversewn with 2-0 silk.  A 14 mm Hemashield tube graft was selected and sewn end-to-end fashion to the proximal aorta using a semi continuous 3-0 Prolene suture.  At the completion of anastomosis three patch stitches of 3-0 Prolene were required for hemostasis.  The graft was cut to appropriate length and sewn end-to-end at the iliac bifurcation using semi-continuous 3-0 Prolene suture.  Prior to completion of this anastomosis, the graft was flushed of air and debris and blood flow was reestablished slowly to the distal native circulation first to the pelvis with external compression on the femoral vessels and finally to the distal native circulation.  The distal anastomosis was competent without leak.,The patient was then given 70 mg of intravenous protamine and final hemostasis obtained using electrocoagulation.  The back bleeding from the inferior mesenteric artery was assessed and was pulsatile and vigorous.  The colon was normal in appearance and this vessel was oversewn using 2-0 silk.  The aneurysm sac was then closed about the grafts snuggly using 3-0 PDS in a vest-over-pants fashion.  The posterior peritoneum was reapproximated using running 3-0 PDS.  The entire large and small bowel were inspected and these structures were well perfused with a strong pulse within the SMA normal appearance of the entire viscera.  The NG tube was positioned in the fundus of the stomach and the viscera returned to their anatomic location.  The midline fascia was then reapproximated using running #1 PDS suture.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with bacitracin and kanamycin solution.  The skin edges coapted using surgical staples.,At the conclusion of the case, sponge and needle counts were correct and a sterile occlusive compressive dressing was applied.",Gastroenterology

He came down on another player's foot sustaining what he describes as an inversion injury. Swelling and pain onset immediately. He was taped but was able to continue playing He was examined by John Houston, the trainer, and had tenderness around the navicular so was asked to come over and see me for evaluation. He has been in a walking boot. He has been taped firmly. Pain with weightbearing activities. He is limping a bit. No significant foot injuries in the past. Most of his pain is located around the dorsal aspect of the hindfoot and midfoot. ,PHYSICAL EXAM:, He does have some swelling from the hindfoot out toward the midfoot. His arch is maintained. His motion at the ankle and subtalar joints is preserved. Forefoot motion is intact. He has pain with adduction and abduction across the hindfoot. Most of this discomfort is laterally. His motor strength is grossly intact. His sensation is intact, and his pulses are palpable and strong. His ankle is not tender. He has minimal to no tenderness over the ATFL. He has no medial tenderness along the deltoid or the medial malleolus. His anterior drawer is solid. His external rotation stress is not painful at the ankle. His tarsometatarsal joints, specifically 1, 2 and 3, are nontender. His maximal tenderness is located laterally along the calcaneocuboid joint and along the anterior process of the calcaneus. Some tenderness over the dorsolateral side of the talonavicular joint as well. The medial talonavicular joint is not tender.,RADIOGRAPHS:, Those done of his foot weightbearing show some changes over the dorsal aspect of the navicular that appear chronic. I don't see a definite fracture. The tarsometarsal joints are anatomically aligned. Radiographs of his ankle again show changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint but no other fractures identified. Review of an MR scan of the ankle dated 12/01/05 shows what looks like some changes along the lateral side of the calcaneocuboid joint with disruption of the lateral ligament and capsular area. Also some changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint. I don't see any significant marrow edema or definitive fracture line. ,IMPRESSION:,  Left Chopart joint sprain.,PLAN:,  I have spoken to XYZ about this. Continue with ice and boot for weightbearing activities. We will start him on a functional rehab program and progress him back to activities when his symptoms allow.

2108,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,Open reduction and internal fixation, high grade Frykman VIII distal radius fracture.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,PREOPERATIVE INDICATIONS: , This is a 52-year-old patient of mine who I have repaired both shoulder rotator cuffs, the most recent one in the calendar year 2007.  While he was climbing a ladder recently in the immediate postop stage, he fell suffering the aforementioned heavily comminuted Frykman fracture.  This fracture had a fragment that extended in the distal radial ulnar joint, a die-punch fragment in the center of the radius.  The ulnar styloid and the radial styloid were off and there were severe dorsal comminutions.  He presented to my office the morning of April 3, 2007, having had a left reduction done elsewhere a day ago.  The reduction, although adequate, had allowed for the fragments to settle and I discussed with him the severity of the injury on a scale of 1-8, this was essentially an 8.  The best results have been either with external fixation or internal fixation, most recently volar plating of a locking variety has been popular, and I felt that this would be appropriate in his case.,Risks and benefits otherwise described were bleeding, infection, need to do operative revise or removal of hardware.  He is taking a job out of state in the next couple of months.  Hence I felt that even with close followup, this is a particularly difficult fracture as far as the morbidity of the injury proceeds.,OPERATIVE NOTE: , After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, one gram of Ancef was given intravenously.  The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in supine position with the left hand in the arm table, magnification was used throughout.  The time out procedure was done to the satisfaction of all present that this was indeed the appropriate extremity on the appropriate patient.  A small C-arm was brought in to help guide the incision which was a volar curvilinear incision that included as part of this due to the fracture blisters eminent compartment syndrome and numbness in fingers.  A carpal tunnel release was done with the transverse carpal ligament being protected with a Freer elevator.  The usual amount of dissection of the pronator quadratus was necessary to view the distal radial fragment.  The pronator quadratus actually grasped several of the fragments itself which had to be dissected free from them, specifically the distal radial ulnar joint and die-punch fragment.  At this point, a locking Synthes distal radius plate from the modular handset was selected that had five articular screws as well as five locking shaft screws.  The ulnar styloid was not affixed in any portion of this repair.  The plate was viewed under the image intensification device, i.e., x-ray and the screws were placed in this order.  The most proximal shaft screw was placed to allow the remainder of the plate to form a buttress to then rearrange the fragments around the locking screws and a locking plate having been selected from the volar approach, a locking 12-mm screw through 16-mm screws were placed in the following order.  Most proximal on the radial shaft of the plate, then the radial styloid, i.e., the most distal and lateral screw, the next most proximal shaft screw followed by the distal radial ulnar joint screw.  Three screws were locking across the die-punch fragment.  The remaining two screws were placed into the radial shaft.  All of these were locking screws of 2 mm in diameter and as the construct was created, the relative motion of the intra-articular fragment in dorsal comminution all diminished greatly, although the exposure as well as the amount of reduction force used was substantial.  The tourniquet time was 1.5 hours.  At this point, the tourniquet was let down.  The entire construct was irrigated with copious amounts of bacitracin and normal saline.  Closure was affected with 0 Vicryl underneath the skin surface followed by 3-0 Prolene in interrupted sutures in the volar wound.  Several image intensification x-rays were taken at the conclusion of the case to check screw length.  Screw lengths were changed out during the case as needed based on the x-ray findings.  The wound was injected with Marcaine, lidocaine, Depo-Medrol, and Kantrex.  A very heavily padded fluffy cotton Jones-type dressing was applied with a volar splint.  Estimated blood loss was 10 mL.  There were no specimens.  Tourniquet time was 1.5 hours.",Orthopedic

Operating microscope was used for both illumination and magnification.,FIRST ASSISTANT: , Nurse practitioner.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed in supine position.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior discectomy and fusion.  An incision was made midline to the anterior body of the sternocleidomastoid at C5-C6 level.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma muscle was divided exposing the carotid sheath, which was retracted laterally.  Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  After placing the self-retaining retractors with the longus colli muscles having been dissected away from the vertebral bodies at C5 and C6 and confirming our position with intraoperative x-rays, we then proceeded with the discectomy.,We then cleaned out the disc at C5-C6 after incising the annulus fibrosis.  We cleaned out the disc with a combination of angled and straight pituitary rongeurs and curettes, and the next step was to clean out the disc space totally.  With this having been done, we then turned our attention with the operating microscope to the osteophytes.  We drilled off the vertebral osteophytes at C5-C6, as well as the uncovertebral osteophytes.  This was removed along with the posterior longitudinal ligament.  After we had done this, the dural sac was opposed very nicely and both C6 nerve roots were thoroughly decompressed.  The next step after the decompression of the thecal sac and both C6 nerve roots was the fusion.  We observed that there was a ____________ in the posterior longitudinal ligament.  There was a free fragment disc, which had broken through the posterior longitudinal ligament just to the right of midline.,The next step was to obtain the bone from the back bone, using cortical cancellous graft 10 mm in size after we had estimated the size.  That was secured into place with distraction being applied on the vertebral bodies using vertebral body distractor.,After we had tapped in the bone plug, we then removed the distraction and the bone plug was fitting nicely.,We then use the Aesculap cervical titanium instrumentation with the 16-mm screws.  After securing the C5-C6 disc with four screws and titanium plate, x-rays showed good alignment of the spine, good placement of the bone graft, and after x-rays showed excellent position of the bone graft and instrumentation, we then placed in a Jackson-Pratt drain in the prevertebral space brought out through a separate incision.  The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and skin was closed with Steri-Strips.  Blood loss during the operation was less than 10 mL.  No complications of the surgery.

Through the ear canal, we removed as much as we could and then infiltrated the canal and postauricular area with 1:100,000 of epinephrine.,We prepped and draped the ear in a sterile fashion.  We reopened the previously used postauricular incision and dissected down the mastoid cortex.  We reflected the soft tissues anteriorly to the level of the ear canal and identified where the ear canal skin entered the defect in the mastoid bone.  A #6 cutting bur was used to drill down the mastoid cortex and identified this cholesteatoma which was then carefully dissected out.  We went all the way to the mastoid antrum.  We finished a complete mastoidectomy with identification of the tegmen, sigmoid sinus.  We removed the lateral aspect of the mastoid tip.  We lowered the facial ridge.  The incudostapedial joint was already membranous in nature, we went ahead and used the joint knife and removed the incus.  We separated the incus from the stapes and then removed it.  We used a malleus head nipper to remove the head of the malleus and then we continued to saucerize the entire mastoid cavity.,There was no cholesteatoma within the middle ear space, but there was roughly 40% surface area perforation.  The remaining portion of the tympanic membrane was extremely calcified and myringosclerotic; this was removed.  There was also a large focus of tympanosclerosis between the stapes crura, which was impinging the ability of the stapes to move.  We carefully dissected this out.  This did seem to improve the mobility of the stapes somewhat.  At this point, there was a near total perforation.  There was only a minimal amount of anterior remnant of the drum left.  We tried to go ahead and harvest the temporalis fascia, but there was really only wisps of this fascia in place.  He had already had a previous tympanoplasty, but even outside the areas where the graft was taken, the temporalis muscle was quite atrophied and lumpy, and I suspect this was due to his chronic disease and long history of corticosteroid usage.  We harvested a few pieces as best as we could.  We went ahead and did a meatoplasty by making a canal incision in the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions.  We excised cartilage posteriorly and inferiorly to enlarge the meatus.  This cartilage was thin and used for cartilage tympanoplasty.  We placed some Gelfoam in the middle ear space and placed the cartilage on the top of it.  We did cut a titanium-PORP of the proper side and placed on top of the stapes capitulum to interface with the cartilage cap.  A few other small pieces of temporalis fascia were used to bulge through the surrounding edges of the cartilage and make sure that it was medial to any remnant of ear canal and tympanic membrane remnants.  We placed a layer of Gelfoam lateral to the graft, closed the postauricular incision in layers and put 2 Merocel packs in the ear.  Glasscock dressing was applied.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  He will be given antibiotics and pain medicines and he will be given instructions to follow up with me in one week.",Surgery
4156,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This 40-year-old white single man was hospitalized at XYZ Hospital in the mental health ward, issues were filled up by his sister and his mother.  The issues involved include the fact that for the last 10 years he has been on disability for psychiatric reasons and has been not working, and in the last several weeks to month he began to call his family talking about the fact that he had been sexually abused by brother.  He has been in outpatient therapy with Jeffrey Silverberg for the past 10 years and Mr. Silverberg became concerned about his behavior, called the family and told them to have him put in the hospital, and at one point called the police because the patient was throwing cellphones and having tantrums in his office.,The history includes the fact that the patient is the 3rd of 4 children.  A brother who is approximately 8 years older, sexually abused brother who is 4 years older.  The brother who is 8 years older lives in California and will contact the family, has had minimal contact for many years.,That brother in California is gay.  The brother who is 4 years older, sexually abused, the patient from age 8 to 12 on a regular basis.  He said, he told his mother several years ago, but she did nothing about it.,The patient finished high school and with some struggle completed college at the University of Houston.  He has a sister who is approximately a year and half younger than he is, who was sexually abused by the brothers will, but only on one occasion.  She has been concerned about patient's behavior and was instrumental in having him committed.,Reportedly, the patient ran away from home at the age of 12 or 13 because of the abuse, but was not able to tell his family what happened.,He had no or minimal psychiatric treatment growing up and after completing college worked in retail part time.,He states he injured his back about 10 yeas ago.  He told he had disk problems but never had surgery.  He subsequently was put on psychiatric disability for depression, states he has been unable to get out of bed at times and isolates and keeps to himself.,He has been on a variety of different medications including Celexa 40 mg and ADD medication different times, and reportedly has used amphetamines in the past, although he denies it at this time.  He minimizes any alcohol use which appears not to be a problem, but what does appear to be a problem is he isolates, stays at home, has been in situations where he brings in people he does not know well and he runs the risk of getting himself physically harmed.,He has never been psychiatrically hospitalized before.,MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:,  Revealed a somewhat disheveled 40-year-old man who was clearly quite depressed and somewhat shocked at his family's commitment.  He says he has not seen them on a regular basis because every time he sees them he feels hurt and acknowledged that he called up the brother who abused him and told the brother's wife what had happened.  The brother has a child and wife became very upset with him.,Normocephalic.  Pleasant, cooperative, disheveled man with about 37 to 40, thoughts were somewhat guarded.

Rheumatoid arthritis.,4.  Suspected mild stress-induced adrenal insufficiency.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission.  She was seen on multiple occasions at Urgent Care and in her physician's office.  Initial x-ray showed some mild diffuse patchy infiltrates.  She was first started on Avelox, but had a reaction, switched to Augmentin, which caused loose stools, and then three days prior to admission was given daily 1 g Rocephin and started on azithromycin.  Her O2 saturations drifted downward.  They were less than 88% when active; at rest, varied between 88% and 92%.  Decision was made because of failed outpatient treatment of pneumonia.  Her medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis.  She is on 20 mg of methotrexate every week as well as Remicade every eight weeks.  Her last dose of Remicade was in the month of June.  Hospital course was relatively unremarkable.  CT scan was performed and no specific focal pathology was seen.  Dr. X, pulmonologist was consulted.  He also was uncertain as to the exact etiology, but viral etiology was most highly suspected.  Because of her loose stools, C. difficile toxin was ordered, although that is pending at the time of discharge.  She was continued on Rocephin IV and azithromycin.  Her fever broke 18 hours prior to discharge, and O2 saturations improved, as did her overall strength and clinical status.  She was instructed to finish azithromycin.  She has two pills left at home.  She is to follow up with Dr. X in two to three days.  Because she is on chronic prednisone therapy, it was suspected that she was mildly adrenal insufficient from the stress of her pneumonia.  She is to continue the increased dose of prednisone at 20 mg (up from 5 mg per day).  We will consult her rheumatologist as to whether to continue her methotrexate, which we held this past Friday.

524,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Malignant mass of the left neck.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Malignant mass of the left neck, squamous cell carcinoma.,PROCEDURES,1.  Left neck mass biopsy.,2.  Selective surgical neck dissection, left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining an informed, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Preoperative antibiotic was given and Dr. X proceeded to intubate the patient after a detailed anesthetic preparation that started in the Same Day Surgery and followed in the operating room.  Finally, a 5.5-French endotracheal tube was inserted and the patient was able to tolerate that and did have stable vital signs and a proper oxygenation.,Then, the patient was positioned with the neck slightly distended and turned toward the opposite side of the operation.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  I proceeded to mark the site of the mass and then also to mark the proposed site for the creation of a flap.  Then, I performed an extensive anesthetic block of the area.,Then, an incision was made along the area marked for development of the flap, but in a very limited extent, just to expose the cervical mass.  The cervical mass, which was about 4 cm in diameter and very firm and rubbery, was found lodged between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein in the area III of the neck.  A wedge sample was sent to Pathology for frozen section.  At the same time, we waited for the result and the initial report was not clear in the sense that a lot of lymphoepithelial reaction was seen.  Therefore, a larger sample was sent to Pathology and at that particular time, the fresh frozen was reported as having squamous elements.  This was not totally clear in my mind and therefore I proceeded to excise the full mass, which luckily was not attached to any structures except in the very deep surface.  There, there were some attachments to branches of the external carotid artery, which had to be suture ligated.  At any rate, the whole specimen was to the lab and finally the diagnosis was that of a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.,With that information in hand, we proceeded to continue with a neck dissection and proceeded to make an incision along the previously marked sites of the flap, which basically involved a reverse U shape on the left neck.  This worked out quite nicely.  The external jugular vein was out of the way, so initially we did not deal with it.  We proceeded to tackle the area III and extended into II-A.  When we excised the mass, the upper end was in intimate relationship with the parotid gland, which was relatively large in this patient, but it looked normal otherwise.  Also, I felt that the submaxillary gland was enlarged.  At any rate, we decided to clean up the areas III and IV and a few nodes from II-A that were removed, and then we went into the posterior triangle where we identified the spinal accessory nerve, which we protected, actually did not even dissect close to it.,The same nerve had been already identified anterior to the internal jugular vein, very proximally behind the digastric and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  At any rate, there were large nodes in the posterior triangle, in areas V-A and V-B, which were excised and sent to Pathology for examination.  Also, there was a remnant of a capsule of the main mass that we proceeded to excise and sent to Pathology as an extra specimen.  Hemostasis was revised and found to be adequate.  The flaps had been protected by folding it to the chest and protected by wet sponges on both sides of the flap.  The flap was replaced in its position.  A soft Jackson-Pratt catheter was left in the area, and then we proceeded to approximate the flap with a number of subcutaneous sutures of Vicryl and then running sutures of subcuticular Monocryl to the skin.  I would like to mention that also the facial vein was excised and the external jugular vein was ligated.  It was in very lateral location and it was on the site of the drain, so we ligated that but did not excise it.  A pressure dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was no more than 100 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room and sent for recovery.",Surgery

4680,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 19-year-old boy with a membranous pulmonary atresia, underwent initial repair 12/04/1987 consisting of pulmonary valvotomy and placement of 4 mm Gore-Tex shunt between the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery with a snare.  This was complicated by shunt thrombosis __________ utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  Resulting in significant hypoxic brain injury where he has been left with static encephalopathy and cerebral palsy.  On 04/07/1988, he underwent heart catheterization and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  He has been followed conservatively since that time.  A recent echocardiogram demonstrated possibly a significant right ventricle outflow tract obstruction with tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity predicting a right ventricular systolic pressure in excess of 180 mmHg.  Right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula was also appreciated.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization to assess hemodynamics associated with his current state of repair.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia breathing on 30% oxygen throughout the case.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 7-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted.  The right femoral vein advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch pulmonary arteries.  This catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 5-French marker pigtail catheter, which was directed into the main pulmonary artery.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  This catheter was then exchanged for a Judkins right coronary catheter for selective cannulation of the right coronary artery.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the main pulmonary artery and right coronary artery.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:,  Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was normal with no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  Left-sided heart was fully saturated.  Phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.  Right ventricular systolic pressure was mildly elevated at 45% systemic level.  There was a 25 mmHg peak systolic gradient across the outflow tract to the main branch pulmonary arteries.  Phasic branch pulmonary artery pressures were normal.  Right-to-left pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending and descending pressures were similar and normal.  The calculated systemic and pulmonary flows were equal and normal.  Vascular resistances were normal.  Angiogram with contrast injection in the main pulmonary artery showed catheter induced pulmonary insufficiency.  The right ventricle appeared mildly hypoplastic with a good contractility and mild tricuspid valve regurgitation.  There is dynamic narrowing of the infundibulum with hypoplastic pulmonary annulus.  The pulmonary valve appeared to be thin and moved well.  The median branch pulmonary arteries were of good size with normal distal arborization.  Angiogram with contrast injection in the right coronary artery showed a non-dominant coronary with a small fistula arising from the proximal right coronary artery coursing over the infundibulum and entering the left facing sinus of the main pulmonary artery.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Membranous pulmonary atresia.,2.  Atrial septal defect.,3.  Right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula.,SURGERIES (INTERVENTIONS):  ,1.  Pulmonary valvotomy surgical.,2.

Operative findings demonstrated the same with normal appearing tubes bilaterally.  The right ovary contained a right ovarian cyst.  The left ovary appeared to be within normal limits.  The peritoneal surfaces were noted to be within normal limits.  The bowel was also noted to be within normal limits.,INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 44-year-old female who had an endometrial ablation done in May, which showed submucosal fibroids.  She had history of anemia and has been on iron therapy.  She started having bleeding three weeks ago with intermittent bouts of flooding.,She desired permanent and definitive therapy and therefore it was felt very appropriate to take the patient for a total abdominal hysterectomy.  The uterus, cervix, and right tube and ovary was sent to pathology for review.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's term.  She was taken to the operating room where a general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was examined under anesthesia with noted findings above.  She was placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first knife and was then carried down to the underlying layer of the fascia.  With the second knife, the fascia was excised in the midline and extended laterally with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with the Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the fascial incision, which in a similar fashion was tented up and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline, the peritoneum was identified, entered bluntly and digitally.  Then the peritoneal incision was then extended superior and inferiorly with excellent visualization of the bladder.  The GYN Balfour was then placed.  A Lahey clamp was placed on the fundus of the uterus to pull the uterus into the operative field and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  Attention was then turned to the round ligaments bilaterally, which were tented up with Allis clamps and then a hemostat was poked through the avascular portion underneath the round ligament and the #O-tie was passed through and then tied down.  Then the round ligament was transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  The round ligaments were then skeletonized to create a window in the broad ligament.  The right infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated through the window created from the round ligaments and then the infundibular ligament on the right was loop tied and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and then transected and suture ligated with a #0 Vicryl in a Heaney stitch fashion.  It was noted to be hemostatic.  Attention was then turned to the left side, in which the uterovarian vessel was isolated and then tied with an #O-tie and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps, transected and suture ligated with a #0 Vicryl in a Heaney stitch fashion and noted to be hemostatic.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then identified, tented up with Allis clamps, and then the bladder flap was created sharply with a Russian and Metzenbaum scissors.  Then the bladder was deflected off of the underlying cervix with blunt dissection with a moist Ray-Tec sponge down to the level of the cervix.,The uterine vessels were skeletonized bilaterally and then clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  In the similar fashion, the broad ligament down to the level of the caudal ligament, the uterosacral ligaments was clamped with curved Ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated, and noted to be hemostatic.  The second Lahey clamp was then placed on the cervix.  The cervix was tented up and the pubocervical vesical fascia was transected with a long knife and then the vagina was entered with a double pointed scissors poked through well protecting posteriorly with a large malleable.  The cuff was then outlined.  The vaginal cuff was grasped with a Ochsner clamp and then the cervix, uterus, and the right tube and ovary were transected using the Jorgenson scissors.  The cuff outlined with Ochsner clamps.  The cuff was then painted with a Betadine soaked Ray-Tec sponge and the sponge was placed over the vagina.  The vaginal cuff was then closed with a #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion holding on to the beginning end on the right side as well as incorporating the ipsilateral cardinal ligaments into the cuff angles.  A long Allis was then used to grasp the mid portion of the cuff and a #0 Vicryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed in the mid portion of the cuff and tied down.  At this time, the abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic.  The suture that was used to close the cuff was then used to come back through the posterior peritoneum grabbing the uterosacral ligaments and the mid portion of the cuff, and then tied down to bring the cuff close and together.  Then, the right round ligament was pulled into the cuff and tied down with the #0 Vicryl that was used as a figure-of-eight stitch in the middle of the cuff.  The left round ligament was too small to reach the cuff.  The abdomen was then again copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic.  The peritoneum was then re-peritonealized with a #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The GYN Balfour and all packing sponges were removed from the abdomen.  Then the abdomen was then once again copiously irrigated and the cuff and incision sites were once again reinspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The ______ was placed back into the hollow of the sacrum.  The omentum was then pulled over to top of the bowel and then the peritoneum was then closed with a #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion and then the fascia was closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The skin was closed with staples and dressing applied.  The patient was then examined at the end of the procedure.  The Betadine-soaked sponge was removed from the vagina.  The cuff was noted to be intact without bleeding and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2 and she was taken to the recovery in stable condition.  The patient will be followed throughout her hospital stay.",Obstetrics / Gynecology

She has had no falls that would contribute to a compression fracture.  She has had a normal DEXA scan on 11/07/2003 that does not really correlate with having a compression fracture of the lumbar spine; however, it is possible that arthritis could contribute to falsely high bone density reading on DEXA scan.

He was then scheduled for I&D and excision of the bursa.  Risks and benefits were discussed.  No guarantees were made or implied.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate sedation was achieved, the left elbow was injected with 0.25% plain Marcaine.  The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  On examination of the left elbow, there was presence of thickening of the bursal sac.  There was a couple of millimeter opening of skin breakdown from where the serous drainage was noted.  An incision was made midline of the olecranon bursa with an elliptical incision around the open wound, which was excised with skin.  The incision was carried proximally and distally.  The olecranon bursa was significantly thickened and scarred.  Excision of the olecranon bursa was performed.  There was significant evidence of thickening of the bursa with some evidence of adhesions.  Satisfactory olecranon bursectomy was performed.  The wound margins were debrided.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated with Pulsavac irrigation lavage system mixed with antibiotic solution.  There was no evidence of a loose body.  There was no bleeding or drainage.  After completion of the bursectomy and I&D, the skin margins, which were excised were approximated with 2-0 nylon in horizontal mattress fashion.  The open area of the skin, which was excised was left _________ and was dressed with 0.25-inch iodoform packing.  Sterile dressings were placed including Xeroform, 4x4, ABD, and Bias.

3288,"SUBJECTIVE:  ,This patient presents to the office today for a checkup.  He has several things to go over and discuss.  First he is sick.  He has been sick for a month intermittently, but over the last couple of weeks it is worse.  He is having a lot of yellow phlegm when he coughs.  It feels likes it is in his chest.  He has been taking Allegra-D intermittently, but he is almost out and he needs a refill.  The second problem, his foot continues to breakout.  It seems like it was getting a lot better and now it is bad again.  He was diagnosed with tinea pedis previously, but he is about out of the Nizoral cream.  I see that he is starting to breakout again now that the weather is warmer and I think that is probably not a coincidence.  He works in the flint and it is really hot where he works and it has been quite humid lately.  The third problem is that he has a wart or a spot that he thinks is a wart on the right middle finger.  He is interested in getting that frozen today.  Apparently, he tells me I froze a previous wart on him in the past and it went away.  Next, he is interested in getting some blood test done.  He specifically mentions the blood test for his prostate, which I informed him is called the PSA.  He is 50 years old now.  He will also be getting his cholesterol checked again because he has a history of high cholesterol.  He made a big difference in his cholesterol by quitting smoking, but unfortunately after taking his social history today he tells me that he is back to smoking.  He says it is difficult to quit.  He tells me he did quit chewing tobacco.  I told him to keep trying to quit smoking.  ,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  General:  With this illness he has had no problems with fever.  HEENT:  Some runny nose, more runny nose than congestion.  Respiratory:  Denies shortness of breath.  Skin:  He has a peeling skin on the bottom of his feet, mostly the right foot that he is talking about today.  At times it is itchy.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight is 238.4 pounds, blood pressure 128/74, temperature 97.8, pulse 80, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.  Skin exam:  I checked out the bottom of his right foot.  He has peeling skin visible consistent with tinea pedis.  On the anterior aspect of the right third finger there is a small little raised up area that I believe represents a wart.  The size of this wart is approximately 3 mm in diameter.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Upper respiratory tract infection, persistent.,2.  Tinea pedis.,3.  Wart on the finger.,4.  Hyperlipidemia.,5.  Tobacco abuse.,PLAN: , The patient is getting a refill on Allegra-D.  I am giving him a refill on the Nizoral 2% cream that he should use to the foot area twice a day.  I gave him instructions on how to keep the foot clean and dry because I think the reason we are dealing with this persistent problem is the fact that his feet are hot and sweaty a lot because of his work.  His wart has been present for some time now and he would like to get it frozen.  I offered him the liquid nitrogen treatment and he did agree to it.  I used liquid nitrogen after a verbal consent was obtained from the patient to freeze the wart.  He tolerated the procedure very well.  I froze it once and I allowed for a 3 mm freeze zone.  I gave him verbal wound care instructions after the procedure.  Lastly, when he is fasting I am going to send him to the lab with a slip, which I gave him today for a basic metabolic profile, CBC, fasting lipid profile, and a screening PSA test.  Lastly, for the upper respiratory tract infection, I am giving him amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day for 10 days.",General Medicine
290,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Malignant pleural effusion, left, with dyspnea.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Malignant pleural effusion, left, with dyspnea.,PROCEDURE:  ,Thoracentesis, left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the recovery area of the operating room.  After obtaining the informed consent, the patient's posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated above the seventh intercostal space in the midscapular line.  Initially, I tried to use the thoracentesis set after 1% Xylocaine had been infiltrated, but the needle of the system was just too short to reach the pleural cavity due to the patient's very thick chest wall.  Therefore, I had to use a #18 spinal needle, which I had to use almost in its entire length to reach the fluid.  From then on, I proceeded manually to withdraw 2000 mL of a light milky fluid.,The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well, but almost at the end of it she said that she was feeling like fainting and therefore we carefully withdrew the needle.  At that time, it was getting difficult to withdraw fluid anyway and we allowed her to lie down and after a few minutes the patient was feeling fine.  At any rate, we gave her bolus of 250 mL of normal saline and the patient returned to her room for additional hours of observation.  We then thought that if she was doing fine, then we will send her home.,A chest x-ray was performed after the procedure which showed a dramatic reduction of the amount of pleural fluid and then there was no pneumothorax or no other obvious complications of her procedure.,",Surgery

She was followed by another rheumatologist.  She says she has been off and on, on prednisone and Arava.  The rheumatologist, as per the patient, would not want her to be on a long-term medicine, so he would give her prednisone and then switch to Arava and then switch her back to prednisone.  She says she had been on prednisone for the last 6 to 9 months.  She is on 5 mg a day.  She recently had a left BKA and there was a question of infection, so it had to be debrided.  I was consulted to see if her prednisone is to be continued.  The patient denies any joint pains at the present time.

She is not on DMARD, but as she recently had a surgery followed by a probable infection, I will hold off on that.  As she has no pain, I have decreased the prednisone to 2.5 mg a day starting tomorrow if she is to go back to her nursing home tomorrow.  If in a couple of weeks her symptoms stay the same, then I would discontinue the prednisone.  I would defer that to Dr. X.  If she flares up at that point, prednisone may have to be restarted with a DMARD, so that eventually she could stay off the prednisone.  I discussed this at length with the patient and she is in full agreement with the plan.

Dissecting further, the peritoneal cavity was entered. Once this done, a Hasson trocar was secured with #1 Vicryl and the abdomen was insufflated without difficulty. A camera was placed into the abdomen and there was noted to be omentum overlying the subhepatic space. A second trocar was placed in the standard fashion in the subxiphoid area; this was a 10/12 mm non-bladed trocar. Once this was done, a grasper was used to try and mobilize the omentum and a second grasper was added in the right costal margin; this was a 5-mm port placed, it was non-bladed and placed in the usual fashion under direct visualization without difficulty. A grasper was used to mobilize free the omentum which was acutely friable and after a significant time-consuming effort was made to mobilize the omentum, it was clear that the gallbladder was well incorporated by the omentum and it would be unsafe to proceed with a laparoscopy procedure and then the procedure was converted to open.,The trocars were removed and a right subcostal incision was made incorporating the 10/12 subxiphoid port. The subcutaneous space was divided with electrocautery, as well as the muscles and fascia. The Bookwalter retraction system was then set up and retractors were placed to provide exposure to the right subhepatic space. Then utilizing a right-angle and electrocautery, the omentum was freed from the gallbladder. An ensuing retrograde cholecystectomy was performed, in which, electrocautery and blunt dissection were used to mobilize the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa; this was done down to the infundibulum. After meticulous dissection, the cystic artery was identified and it was ligated between 3-0 silks. Several other small ties were placed on smaller bleeding vessels and the cystic duct was identified, was skeletonized, and a 3-0 stick tie was placed on the proximal portion of it. After it was divided, the gallbladder was freed from the field.,Once this was done, the liver bed was inspected for hemostasis and this was achieved with electrocautery. Copious irrigation was also used. A 19-French Blake drain was placed in Morrison's pouch lateral to the gallbladder fossa and was secured in place with 2-0 nylon; this was a 19-French round Blake. Once this was done, the umbilical port was closed with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion and then the wound was closed in two layers with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion. The skin was closed with and absorbable stitch.,The patient was then awakened from anesthesia, extubated, and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.",Surgery

Flow to right upper lobe more than left upper lobe from collaterals arising from branches of the aortic arch.,PROCEDURE (S):, Right heart and left heart catheterization by way of right femoral artery, right femoral vein, and right internal jugular vein.,I. PROCEDURES:, XXXXXX was brought to the catheterization lab and was anesthetized by anesthesia. He was intubated. His supplemental oxygen was weaned to 24%, on which all of his hemodynamics were obtained. The patient was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion, including both groins and the right neck. Xylocaine was administered in the right femoral area. A 6-French sheath was introduced into the right femoral vein percutaneously without complication. A 4-French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery percutaneously without complication. A 4-French pigtail catheter was introduced and passed to the abdominal aorta.,Dr. Hayes, using the SiteRite device, introduced a 5-French sheath into the right internal jugular vein without complication.,A 5-French wedge catheter was introduced through the sheath in the right internal jugular vein and was passed to the left pulmonary artery and further to the left pulmonary capillary wedge position. This catheter would not pass to the right pulmonary artery. The wedge catheter was removed. A 5-French IMA catheter was then introduced and passed to the right pulmonary artery. After right pulmonary artery pressure was measured, this catheter was removed.,The 5 wedge catheter was advanced through the right femoral sheath and was passed to the following chambers or vessels: Inferior vena cava, right atrium, left atrium, and right ventricle.,The previously introduced 4 pigtail catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta. Simultaneous right ventricular and ascending aortic pressures were measured. A pullback from ascending aorta to descending aorta was then performed. Simultaneous measurements of right ventricular and descending aortic pressures were measured.,The wedge catheter was removed. A 5-French Berman catheter was advanced down the Glenn shunt to the right pulmonary artery, where a pullback from right pulmonary artery to Glenn shunt was performed. An injection was then performed using Omnipaque 16 mL at 8 mL per second with the Berman catheter positioned in the Glenn shunt. The 5-French Berman was removed.,A 6-French Berman was introduced through the right femoral vein sheath and was advanced to the right ventricle. A right ventriculogram was performed using Omnipaque 18 mL at 12 mL per second. The Berman catheter was pulled back to the inferior vena cava, where an inferior vena cavagram was performed using Omnipaque 10 mL at 8 mL per second.,The 4-French pigtail catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta and an ascending aortogram was performed using Omnipaque 16 mL at 12 mL per second.,Following the ascending angiograms, two kidneys and a bladder were noted. The catheters and sheaths were removed, and hemostasis was obtained by direct pressure. The estimated blood loss was less than 30 mL, and none was replaced. Heparin was administered following placement of all of the sheaths. Pulse oximetry saturation, pulse in the right foot, and EKG were monitored continuously.,II. PRESSURES:,A. Left pulmonary artery, mean of 11; left capillary wedge, mean of 9; main pulmonary artery, mean of 12; right pulmonary artery, mean of 10; descending aorta, 75/45, mean of 57; right atrium, A6 to 9, V6 to 8, mean 7; left atrium, mean 8; inferior vena cava, mean 7.,B. Ascending aorta, 65/35, with a simultaneous right ventricular pressure of 70/10; descending aorta, 60/35, with a right ventricular pressure of 72/10.,C. Pullbacks, left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery, mean of 11 to mean of 12; main pulmonary artery to Glenn, mean of 12 to mean of 13; right pulmonary artery to Glenn, mean of 12 to mean of 13; ascending aorta 68/35 to descending aorta 62/35.,INTERPRETATION:, Right and left pulmonary artery pressures are appropriate for this situation. There is a gradient of, at most, 2 mmHg on pullback from both the right and left pulmonary arteries to the Glenn shunt. The left atrial mean pressure is normal. Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure is, at most, slightly elevated. There is a trivial gradient between the right ventricle and ascending aorta consistent with trivial neo-aortic valve stenosis. There is a roughly 10-mm gradient between the right ventricle and descending aorta, consistent with additional coarctation of the aorta. On pullback from ascending to descending aorta, there is a 6-mmHg gradient between the two. Systemic blood pressure is normal.,III. OXIMETRY:, Superior vena cava 65, right pulmonary artery 67, left pulmonary artery 65, left atrium 96, right atrium 87, inferior vena cava 69, aorta 86, right ventricle 83.,INTERPRETATION:, Systemic arteriovenous oxygenation difference is normal, consistent with a normal cardiac output. Left atrial saturation is fairly normal, consistent with normal oxygenation in the lungs. The saturation falls passing from the left atrium to the right atrium and further to the right ventricle, consistent with mixing of pulmonary venous return and inferior vena cava return, as would be expected in this patient.,IV. SPECIAL PROCEDURE (S):, None done.,V. CALCULATIONS:,Please see the calculation sheet. Calculations were based upon an assumed oxygen consumption. The _____ saturation used was 67%, with a pulmonary artery saturation of 65%, a left atrial saturation of 96%, and an aortic saturation of 86%. Using the above information, the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio was 0.6. Systemic blood flow was 5.1 liters per minute per meter squared. Pulmonary blood flow was 3.2 liters per minute per meter squared. Systemic resistance was 9.8 Wood's units times meter squared, which is mildly diminished. Pulmonary resistance was 2.5 Wood's units times meter squared, which is in the normal range.,VI. ANGIOGRAPHY:, The injection to the Glenn shunt demonstrates a wide-open Glenn connection. The right pulmonary artery is widely patent, without stenosis. The proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery is significantly narrowed, but does open up near its branch point. The right pulmonary artery measures 6.5, the left pulmonary artery measures 3.0 mm. The aorta at the diaphragm on a later injection was 5.5 mm. There is a small collateral off the innominate vein passing to the left upper lobe. Flow to both upper lobes is diminished versus lower lung fields. There is normal return of the pulmonary veins from the right, with simultaneous filling of the left atrium and right atrium. There is normal return of the left lower pulmonary vein and left upper pulmonary vein. There is some reflux of dye into the inferior vena cava from the right atrium.,The right ventriculogram demonstrates a heavily pedunculated right ventricle with somewhat depressed right ventricular systolic function. The calculated ejection fraction from the LAO projection is only mildly diminished at 59%. There is no significant tricuspid regurgitation. The neo-aortic valve appears to open well with no stenosis. The ascending aorta is dilated. There is mild narrowing of the aorta at the isthmal area. On some projections, there appears to be a partial duplication of the aortic arch, probably secondary to this patient's style of Norwood reconstruction. There is some filling of the right upper and left upper lobes from collateral blood flow, with the left being more opacified than the right.,The inferior vena cavagram demonstrates normal return of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium.,The ascending aortogram demonstrates trivial aortic insufficiency, which is probably catheter-induced. The coronary arteries are poorly seen. Again, a portion of the aorta appears to be partially duplicated. There is faint opacification of the left upper lung from collateral blood flow. The above-mentioned narrowing of the aortic arch is again noted.",Surgery

The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A speculum was placed on the eyelids and microscope was brought into position. A #7-0 Vicryl suture was passed through the superotemporal limbus and traction suture was placed at the superotemporal limbus and the eye was rotated infranasally so as to expose the superotemporal conjunctiva. At this point, smooth forceps and Westcott scissors were used to create a 100-degree superotemporal conjunctival peritomy, approximately 2 mm posterior to the superotemporal limbus. This was then dissected anteriorly to the limbus edge and then posteriorly. Steven scissors were then dissected in a superotemporal quadrant between the superior and lateral rectus muscles to provide good exposure. At this point, we primed the Ahmed valve with a #27 gauge cannula using BSS and it was noted to be patent. We then placed Ahmed valve in the superotemporal subconjunctival recess underneath the subtenon space and this was pushed posteriorly. We then measured with calipers so that it was positioned 9 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed valve was then tacked down with #8-0 nylon suture through both fenestrations. We then applied light cautery to the superotemporal episcleral bed. We placed a paracentesis at the temporal position and inflated the anterior chamber with a small amount of Healon. We then used a #23 gauge needle and entered the superotemporal sclera, approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus into the anterior chamber away from iris and away from cornea. We then trimmed the tube, beveled up in a 30 degree fashion with Vannas scissors, and introduced the tube through the #23 gauge tract into the anterior chamber so that approximately 2-3 mm of tube was extending into the anterior chamber. We burped some of the Healon out of the anterior chamber and filled it with BSS and we felt that the tube was in good position away from the lens, away from the cornea, and away from the iris. We then tacked down the tubes to the sclera with #8-0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of- eight fashion. The pericardium was soaked in gentamicin. We then folded the pericardium 1x1 cm piece onto itself and then placed it over the tube and this was tacked down in all four quadrants to the sclera with #8-0 nylon suture. At this point, we then re-approximated the conjunctiva to its original position and we closed it with an #8-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle in a running fashion with interrupted locking bites. We then removed the traction suture. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was deep, the tube appeared to be well positioned. The remaining portion of the Healon was burped out of the anterior chamber with BSS and the pressure was felt to be adequate. The speculum was removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Then, an eye patch and shield were placed over the eye. The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",Ophthalmology

Lymph node package, additional level 8 lymph node.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 100 mL.,CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AFTER SURGERY: , Stable.,HISTORY OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was given preoperative informed consent for the procedure as well as for the clinical trial he was enrolled into.  The patient agreed based on the risks and the benefits of the procedure, which were presented to him and was taken to the operating room.  A correct time out procedure was performed.  The patient was placed into the supine position.  He was given general anesthesia, was endotracheally intubated without incident with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used to perform confirmation of adequate placement of the double-lumen tube.  Following this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  The patient was rolled into the right lateral decubitus position with the left side up.  All pressure points were padded.  The patient had a sterile DuraPrep preparation to the left chest.  A sterile drape around that was applied.  Also, the patient had Marcaine infused into the incision area.  Following this, the patient had a posterolateral thoracotomy incision, which was a muscle-sparing incision with a posterior approach just over the ausculatory triangle.  The incision was approximately 10 cm in size.  This was created with a 10-blade scalpel.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the subcutaneous tissues.  The auscultatory triangle was opened.  The posterior aspect of the latissimus muscle was divided from the adjacent tissue and retracted anteriorly.  The muscle was not divided.  After the latissimus muscle was retracted anteriorly, the ribs were counted, and the sixth rib was identified.  The superior surface of the sixth rib was incised with Bovie electrocautery and the sixth rib was divided with rib shears.  Following this, the patient had the entire intercostal muscle separated from the superior aspect of the sixth rib on the left as far as the Bovie would reach.  The left lung was allowed to collapse and meticulous inspection of the left lung identified the lesions, which were taken out with stapled wedge resections via a TA30 green load stapler for all of the wedges.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  The largest lesion was the left upper lobe apex lesion, which was possibly multiple lesions, which was taken in one large wedge segment, and this was also adjacent to another area of the wedges.  The patient had multiple pleural abnormalities, which were identified on the surface of the lung.  These were small white spotty looking lesions and were not confirmed to be tumor implants, but were suspicious to be multiple areas of tumor.  Based on this, the wedges of the tumors that were easily palpable were excised with complete excision of all palpable lesions.  Following this, the patient had a 32-French chest tube placed in the anteroapical position.  A 19-French Blake was placed in the posterior apical position.  The patient had the intercostal space reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl suture, and the lung was allowed to be re-expanded under direct visualization.  Following this, the chest tubes were placed to Pleur-evac suction and the auscultatory triangle was closed with 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The deeper tissue was closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with running 4-0 Monocryl suture in a subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and had no complications.",Surgery

1487,"HISTORY:,  A is here for a follow up appointment at our Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic as well as the CCS Clinic.  A is a 17-year-old male with oligoarticular arthritis of his right knee.  He had a joint injection back in 03/2007 and since then he has been doing relatively well.  He is taking Indocin only as needed even though he said he has pain regularly, and he said that his knee has not changed since the beginning, but he said he only takes the medicine when he has pain, which is not every day, but almost every day.  He denies any swelling more than what it was before, and he denies any other joints are affected at this moment.  Denies any fevers or any rashes.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  On physical examination, his temperature is 98.6, weight is 104.6 kg; which is 4.4 kg less than before, 108/70 is his blood pressure, weight is 91.0 kg, and his pulse is 80.  He is alert, active, and oriented in no distress.  He has no facial rashes, no lymphadenopathy, no alopecia.  Funduscopic examination is within normal limit.  He has no cataracts and symmetric pupils to light and accommodation.  His chest is clear to auscultation.  The heart has a regular rhythm with no murmur.  The abdomen is soft and nontender with no :  visceromegaly.  Musculoskeletal examination showed good range of motion of all his upper extremities with no swelling or tenderness.  Lower extremities:  He still has some weakness of the knees, hip areas, and the calf muscles.  He does have minus/plus swelling of the right knee with a very hypermobile patella.  There is no limitation in his range of motion, and the swelling is very minimal with some mild tenderness.,In terms of his laboratories, they were not done today.,ASSESSMENT: , This is a 17-year-old male with oligoarticular arthritis.  He is HLA-B27 negative.,PLAN:,  In terms of the plan, I discussed with him what things he should be taking and the fact that since he has persistent symptoms, he should be on medication every day.  I am going to switch him to Indocin 75 mg SR just to give more sustained effect to his joints, and if he does not respond to this or continue with the symptoms, we may need to get an MRI.  We will see him back in three months.  He was evaluated by our physical therapist, who gave him some recommendations in terms of exercise for his lower extremities.  Future plans for A may include physical therapy and more stronger medications as well as imaging studies with an MRI.  Today he received his flu shot.

1838,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Gangrene osteomyelitis, right second toe.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Gangrene osteomyelitis, right second toe.,OPERATIVE REPORT:  ,The patient is a 58-year-old female with poorly controlled diabetes with severe lower extremity lymphedema.  The patient has history of previous right foot infection requiring first ray resection.  The patient has ulcerations of right second toe dorsally at the proximal interphalangeal joint, which has failed to respond to conservative treatment.  The patient now has exposed bone and osteomyelitis in the second toe.  The patient has been on IV antibiotics as an outpatient and has failed to respond to these and presents today for surgical intervention.,After an IV was started by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken back to the operating room and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  A restraint belt was placed around the patient's waist using copious amounts of Webril and an ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the patient's right ankle and the patient was made comfortable by the Department of Anesthesia.  After adequate amounts of sedation had been given to the patient, we administered a block of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain in proximal digital block around the second digit.  The foot and ankle were then prepped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was elevated and an Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was brought back onto the table.  Using Band-Aid scissors, the stockinet was cut and reflected and using a wet and dry sponge, the foot was wiped, cleaned, and the second toe identified.,Using a skin scrape, a racket type incision was planned around the second toe to allow also remodelling of previous operative site.  Using a fresh #10 blade, skin incision was made circumferentially in the racket-shaped manner around the second digit.  Then, using a fresh #15 blade, the incision was deepened and was taken down to the level of the second metatarsophalangeal joint.  Care was taken to identify bleeders and cautery was used as necessary for hemostasis.  After cleaning up all the soft tissue attachments, the second digit was disarticulated down to the level of the metatarsophalangeal joint.  The head of the second metatarsal was inspected and was noted to have good glistening white cartilage with no areas of erosion evident by visual examination.  Attention was then directed to closure of the wound.  All remaining tissue was noted to be healthy and granular in appearance with no necrotic tissue evident.  Areas of subcutaneous tissue were then removed through a sharp dissection in order to allow better approximation of the skin edges.  Due to long-standing lower extremity lymphedema and postoperative changes on previous surgery, I thought that we were unable to close the incision in entirety.  Therefore, after copious amounts of irrigation using sterile saline, it was determined to use modified dental rolls using #4-0 gauze to remove tension from the skin.  Deep vertical mattress sutures were used in order to reapproximate more closely, the skin edges and bring the plantar flap of skin up to the dorsal skin.  This was obtained using #2-0 nylon suture.  Following this, the remaining exposed tissue from the wound was covered using moist to dry saline soaked 4 x 4 gauze.  The wound was then dressed using 4 x 4 gauze fluffed with abdominal pads, then using Kling and Kerlix and an ACE bandage to provide compression.  The tourniquet was deflated at 42 minutes' time and hemostasis was noted to be achieved.  The ACE bandage was extended up to just below the knee and no bleeding striking to the bandages was appreciated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact, as was evidenced by capillary bleeding, which was present during the procedure.  Sedation was given postoperative introductions, which include to remain nonweightbearing to her right foot.  The patient was instructed to keep the foot elevated and to apply ice behind her knee as necessary, no more than 20 minutes each hour.  The patient was instructed to continue her regular medications.  The patient was to continue IV antibiotic course and was given prescription for Vicoprofen to be taken q.4h. p.r.n. for moderate to severe pain #30.  The patient will followup with Podiatry on Monday morning at 8:30 in the Podiatry Clinic for dressing change and evaluation of her foot at that time.,The patient was instructed as to signs and symptoms of infection, was instructed to return to the Emergency Department immediately if these should present.  The second digit was sent to Pathology for gross and micro.",Podiatry

A CT scan of his abdomen showed evidence of appendicitis with perforation.  He was evaluated in the Emergency Department and placed on the appendicitis critical pathway for this acute appendicitis process.  He required several boluses of fluid for tachycardia and evidence of dehydration.,I met with Carlos' parents and talked to them about the diagnosis of appendicis and surgical risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options.  All their questions have been answered and they agree with the surgical plan.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient had acute perforated appendicitis with diffuse suppurative peritonitis including multiple intraloop abscesses and purulent debris in all quadrants of the abdomen including the perihepatic and subphrenic recesses as well.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  A Foley catheter was placed for decompression, and his abdomen was prepared and draped in a standard fashion.  A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated in the soft tissues around his umbilicus and in the suprapubic and left lower quadrant locations chosen for trocar insertion.  We conducted our surgical timeout and reiterated all of Carlos' unique and important identifying information and confirmed the diagnosis of appendicitis and planned laparoscopic appendectomy as the procedure.  A 1-cm vertical infraumbilical incision was made and an open technique was used to place a 12-mm Step trocar through the umbilical fascia.  CO2 was insufflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg and then two additional 5-mm working ports were placed in areas that had been previously anesthetized.,There was a lot of diffuse purulent debris and adhesions between the omentum and adjacent surfaces of the bowel and the parietal peritoneum.  After these were gently separated, we began to identify the appendix.  In the __________ due to the large amount of small bowel dilatation and distension, I used the hook cautery with the lowest intraperitoneal __________ profile to coagulate the mesoappendix.  The base of the appendix was then ligated with 2-0 PDS Endoloops, and the appendix was amputated and withdrawn through the umbilical port.  I spent the next 10 minutes irrigating purulent fluid and debris from the peritoneal cavity using 2 L of sterile crystalloid solution and a suction power irrigation system.  When this was complete, the CO2 was released one final time and as much of the fluid was drained from the peritoneal cavity as possible.  The umbilical fascia was closed with figure-of-eight suture of 0 Monocryl and the skin incisions were closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  His blood loss was less than 10 mL, and he received only crystalloid fluid during the procedure.",Gastroenterology

While here she had a couple of other issues as well.  She stated that she has been having some right shoulder pain.  She denies any injury but certain range of motion does cause it to hurt.  No weakness, numbness or tingling.  As far as her diabetes she states that she only checks her blood sugars in the morning and those have all been ranging less than 100.  She has not been checking any two hours after meals.  Her blood pressures when she does check them have been running normal as well but she does not have any record of these present with her.  No other issues or concerns.  Upon review of her chart it did show that she had a benign breast biopsy done back on 06/11/04 and was told to have a repeat mammogram in six months but she has never had that done so she is needing to have this done as well.,ALLERGIES: , None.,MEDICATIONS:,  She is on Hyzaar 50/12.5 one-half p.o. daily, coated aspirin daily, lovastatin 40 mg one-half tab p.o. daily, multivitamin daily, metformin 500 mg one tab p.o. b.i.d.; however, she has been skipping her second dose during the day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  She is a nonsmoker.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  As noted above.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs:  Temperature:  98.2.

Microscopic-assisted revision of bilateral decompressive lumbar laminectomies and foraminotomies at the levels of L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1.,2.  Posterior spinal fusion at the level of L4-L5 and L5-S1 utilizing local bone graft, allograft and segmental instrumentation.,3.  Posterior lumbar interbody arthrodesis utilizing cage instrumentation at L4-L5 with local bone graft and allograft.  All procedures were performed under SSEP, EMG, and neurophysiologic monitoring.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Approximately 1000 cc.,CELL SAVER RETURNED:  ,Approximately 550 cc.,SPECIMENS: , None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DRAIN: , 8-inch Hemovac.,SURGICAL INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 59-year-old male who had severe disabling low back pain.  He had previous lumbar laminectomy at L4-L5.  He was noted to have an isthmic spondylolisthesis.,Previous lumbar laminectomy exacerbated this condition and made it further unstable.  He is suffering from neurogenic claudication.  He was unresponsive to extensive conservative treatment.  He has understanding of the risks, benefits, potential complications, treatment alternatives and provided informed consent.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR #5 where he was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia.  He was subsequently placed prone on the Jackson's spinal table with all bony prominences well padded.  His lumbar spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A previous midline incision was extended from approximate level of L3 to S1.  This was in the midline.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue were debrided sharply.  Electrocautery provided hemostasis.  ,Electrocautery was utilized to dissect through subcutaneous tissue of lumbar fascia.  The lumbar fascia was identified and split in the midline.  Subperiosteal dissection was then carried out with electrocautery and ______ elevated from the suspected levels of L3-S1.  Once this was exposed, the transverse processes, a Kocher clamp was placed and a localizing cross-table x-ray confirmed the interspace between the spinous processes of L3-L4.  Once this was completed, a self-retaining retractor was then placed.  With palpation of the spinous processes, the L4 posterior elements were noted to be significantly loosened and unstable.  These were readily mobile with digital palpation.  A rongeur was then utilized to resect the spinous processes from the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  This bone was morcellized and placed on the back table for utilization for bone grafting.  The rongeur was also utilized to thin the laminas from the inferior half of L3 to superior half of S1.  Once this was undertaken, the unstable posterior elements of L4 were meticulously dissected free until wide decompression was obtained.  Additional decompression was extended from the level of the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  The microscope was utilized during this portion of procedure for visualization.  There was noted to be no changes during the decompression portion or throughout the remainder of the surgical procedure.  Once decompression was deemed satisfactory, the nerve roots were individually inspected and due to the unstable spondylolisthesis, there was noted to be tension on the L4 and L5 nerve roots crossing the disc space at L4-L5.  Once this was identified, foraminotomies were created to allow additional mobility.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  Working type screws, provisional titanium screws were then placed at L4-l5.  This was to allow distraction and reduction of the spondylolisthesis.  These were placed in the pedicles of L4 and L5 under direct intensification.  The position of the screws were visualized, both AP and lateral images.  They were deemed satisfactory.,Once this was completed, a provisional plate was applied to the screws and distraction applied across L4-L5.  This allowed for additional decompression of the L5 and L4 nerve roots.  Once this was completed, the L5 nerve root was traced and deemed satisfactory exiting neural foramen after additional dissection and discectomy were performed.  Utilizing a series of interbody spacers, a size 8 mm spacer was placed within the L4-L5 interval.  This was taken in sequence up to a 13 mm space.  This was then reduced to a 11 mm as it was much more anatomic in nature.  Once this was completed, the spacers were then placed on the left side and distraction obtained.  Once the distraction was obtained to 11 mm, the interbody shavers were utilized to decorticate the interbody portion of L4 and L5 bilaterally.  Once this was taken to 11 mm bilaterally, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  A 11 mm height x 9 mm width x 25 mm length carbon fiber cages were packed with local bone graft and Allograft.  There were impacted at the interspace of L4-L5 under direct image intensification.  Once these were deemed satisfactory, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The provisional screws and plates were removed.  This allowed for additional compression along L4-L5 with the cage instrumentation.  Permanent screws were then placed at L4, L5, and S1 bilaterally.  This was performed under direct image intensification.  The position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  Once this was completed, the posterolateral gutters were decorticated with an AM2 Midas Rex burr down to bleeding subchondral bone.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The morcellized Allograft and local bone graft were mixed and packed copiously from the transverse processes of L4-S1 bilaterally.  A 0.25 inch titanium rod was contoured of appropriate length to span from L4-S1.  Appropriate cross connecters were applied and the construct was placed over the pedicle screws.  They were tightened and sequenced to allow additional posterior reduction of the L4 vertebra.  Once this was completed, final images in the image intensification unit were reviewed and were deemed satisfactory.  All connections were tightened and retightened in Torque 2 specifications.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The dura was inspected and noted to be free of tension.  At the conclusion of the procedure, there was noted to be no changes on the SSEP, EMG, and neurophysiologic monitors.  An 8-inch Hemovac drain was placed exiting the wound.  The lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl in interrupted fashion, the subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, surgical stainless steel clips were used to approximate the skin.  The remainder of the Hemovac was assembled.  Bulky compression dressing utilizing Adaptic, 4x4, and ABDs was then affixed to the lumbar spine with Microfoam tape.  He was turned and taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded.",Neurosurgery

He awoke during the night with severe ear pain, and mom states that this is the third time this year he has had earaches.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,Patient reports that he felt good after taking antibiotics with each earache episode and has recently started on the wrestling team.  Mom reports that patient has been afebrile with each of the earache episodes, and he has not had upper respiratory symptoms.  Patient denies any head trauma associated with wrestling practice.,BIRTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:,  Patient's mother reports a normal pregnancy with no complications, having received prenatal care from 12 weeks.  Vaginal delivery was uneventful with a normal perinatal course.  Patient sat alone at 6 months, crawled at 9 months, and walked at 13 months.  His verbal and motor developmental milestones were as expected.,FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: , Patient lives with both parents and two siblings (brother - age 11 years, sister - age 15 years).  He reports enjoying school, remains active in scouts, and is very excited about being on the wresting team.  Mom reports that he has several friends, but she is concerned about the time required for the wrestling team.  Patient is in 8th grade this year and an A/B student.  Both siblings are healthy.  His Dad has hypertension and has frequent heartburn symptoms that he treats with over-the-counter (OTC) medications.  Mom is healthy and has asthma.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Patient has been seen in the clinic yearly for well child exams.  He has had no major illnesses or hospitalizations.  He had one emergency room visit 2 years ago for a knee laceration.  Patient has been healthy except for the past year when he had two episodes of otitis media not associated with respiratory infections.  He received antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) for the otitis media and both episodes resolved without problems.  Patient's Mom states that he takes no prescribed medications or OTC medications, but he admits that he has been taking his dad's OTC Pepcid AE sometimes when he gets heartburn.  Upon further examination, he reports taking Pepcid when he eats pizza or Mexican food.  He does complain of sore throats sometimes and often feels burning in his throat when he goes to sleep at night after a late evening snack.,NUTRITIONAL HISTORY: , Patient eats cereal bars or pop tarts with milk for breakfast most days.  He takes his lunch (usually a sandwich and chips or yogurt and fruit) for lunch.  Mom or his sister cooks supper in the evening.  The family goes out to eat once or twice a week and he only gets ""fast food"" once or twice a week according to his Mom.  He says he eats ""a lot"" especially after a wrestling meet.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,Height/weight:  Patient weighs 109 pounds (60th percentile) and is 69 inches tall (93rd percentile).

A barium swallow and upper GI was scheduled for the following week.  It showed marked GE reflux.,ASSESSMENT: , The differential diagnoses for patient included (a) chronic otitis media/treatment failure, (b) peptic ulcer disease/gastritis, (c) gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) or carbonated beverage syndrome, (d) trauma.,CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA. , Chronic otitis media due to a penicillin resistant organism would be the obvious diagnosis in this case.  It is rare for an adolescent to have otitis media with no precipitating factor (such as being on a swim team or otherwise exposed to unusual organisms or in an unusual environment).  It is certainly unusual for him to have three episodes in 1 year.,PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.,  There were no symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, a negative H. pylori screen and lack of pain made this diagnosis less likely.  Trauma.  Trauma was a possibility, particularly since adolescent males frequently minimize symptoms especially if they might limit participation in a sport but patient maintained that he had not had an event where he struck his head or neck and that he always wore his helmet with ear padding.,GERD.,  The history of ""heartburn"" relieved by his father's medication was striking.  The positive study supported the diagnosis of GERD, which was severe and chronic enough to cause irritation of the mucosal surfaces exposed to the gastric juices and edema, inflammation in the inner ears.,PLAN:,  Patient and his Mom agreed to a trial of omeprazole 20 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks.  Patient was to keep a diary of any episodes of heartburn, including what foods seemed to aggravate it.  The clinician asked him to avoid using any antacid products in the meantime to gage the effectiveness of the medication.  He was also given a prescription for 10 days of Augmentin99 and a follow-up appointment for 2 weeks.  At his follow-up appointment he reported one episode after he ate a whole large pizza after wrestling practice but said it went away pretty quickly after he took his medication.

4526,"REASON FOR VISIT:,  This is a routine return appointment for this 71-year-old woman with chronic atrial fibrillation.  Her chief complaint today is shortness of breath.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  I last saw her in 09/2008.  Since then, she has been admitted to ABCD Hospital from 11/05/2008 through 11/08/2008 for a near syncopal episode.  She was found to have a fast heart rate in the atrial fibrillation.  She was also found to be in heart failure and so they diuresed her.  They wanted to send her home on furosemide 40 mg daily, but unfortunately they never gave her a prescription for this and so she now is not on any furosemide and since being discharged she has regained fluid to no one's great surprise.  My plan advent is to control her heart rate.  This has been a bit difficult with her retaining fluid.  We will try again to diurese her as an outpatient and go forward from there with rate control and anticoagulation.  She may need to have a pacemaker placed and her AV node ablated if this does not work.,She notes the shortness of breath and wheezing at nights.  I think these are manifestations of heart failure.  She has peripheral edema.  She is short of breath when she tries to walk a city block.  I believe she takes her medications as directed, but I am never sure she actually is taking them correctly.  In any case, she did not bring her medications with her today.,Today, she had an ECG which shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 117 beats per minute.  There is a nonspecific IVCD.  This is unchanged from her last visit except that her heart rate is faster.  In addition, I reviewed her echocardiogram done at XYZ.

Her blood pressure today was 130/60 and her pulse 116 blood pressure and regular.  She is 5 feet 11 inches and her weight is 167 pounds, which is up from 158 pounds from when I saw her last visit.  She is breathing 1two times per minute and it is unlabored.  Eyelids are normal.  She has vitiligo.  Pupils are round and reactive to light.  Conjunctivae are clear and sclerae are anicteric.  There is no oral thrush or central cyanosis.  She has marked keloid formation on both sides of her neck, the left being worse than the right.  The jugular venous pressure is elevated.  Carotids are brisk are without bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion.  The precordium is quiet.  The rhythm is irregularly irregular.  She has a variable first and second heart sounds.  No murmurs today.  Abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses, although she does have hepatojugular reflux.

After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.  Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal.  Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.

This was filled with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  At L4-L5, we used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer with structural autograft and BMP, and then we placed a two-level 87-mm Integra sacral plate with 28 x 6-mm screws, two each at L4 and L5 and 36 x 6-mm screws at S1.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Dr. X made the approach, and once the L5-S1 disk space was identified, we incised this with a knife and then removed a large core of bone taking rotating cutters.  I was able to remove additional disk space and score the vertebral bodies.  The rest of the disk removal was done with the curette, scraping the endplates.  I tried various sized spacers, and at this point, we exposed the L5 body and took a dowel from the body and filled the hole with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  Half of this was used to fill the spacer at L5-S1, BMP was placed in the spacer as well and then it was tapped into place.  We then moved the vessels over the opposite way approaching the L4-L5 disk space laterally, and the disk was removed in a similar fashion and we also used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer, but this is the variety that we could put in from one side.  This was filled with bone and BMP as well.  Once this was done, we were able to place an 87-mm Integra sacral plate down over the three vertebral bodies and place these screws.

Hemodynamic monitoring was begun.  Time-out was called and the patient eye operated upon and lens implant intended were verbally verified.  Three drops of tetracaine were applied to the operative eye.  The patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion for intraocular surgery.  A lid speculum was placed.  Two paracentesis sites were created approximately 120 degrees apart straddling the temple using a slit knife.  The anterior chamber was irrigated with a dilute 0.25% solution of non-preserved lidocaine and filled with Viscoat.  The clear corneal temporal incision was fashioned.  The anterior chamber was entered by introducing a keratome.  The continuous tear capsulorrhexis was performed using the bent needle cystotome and completed with Utrata forceps.  The cataractous lens was then hydrodissected and phacoemulsified using a modified phaco-chop technique.  Following removal of the last nuclear quadrant, there was noted to be a posterior capsular hole nasally.  This area was tamponaded with Healon.  The anterior chamber was swept with a cyclodialysis spatula and there was noted to be vitreous prolapse.  An anterior vitrectomy was then performed bimanually until the vitreous was cleared from the anterior chamber area.  The sulcus area of the lens was then inflated using Healon and a V9002 16.0 diopter intraocular lens was unfolded and centered in the sulcus area with haptic secured in the sulcus.  There was noted to be good support.  Miostat was injected into the anterior chamber and viscoelastic agent rinsed out of the eye with Miostat.  Gentle bimanual irrigation, aspiration was performed to remove remaining viscoelastic agents anteriorly.  The pupil was noted to constrict symmetrically.  Wounds were checked with Weck-cels and found to be free of vitreous.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to normal depth as confirmed by tactile pressure at about 12.  All corneal wounds were then hydrated, checked and found to be watertight and free of vitreous.  A single 10-0 nylon suture was placed temporarily as prophylaxis and the knot buried.

Right thoracotomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia with a dual-lumen tube.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed.  In addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed.  The patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure.  His abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  After applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus.  Dissection was carried down through the linea using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened.  Next, a Balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor.  Next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach.  In an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade.  We incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade.  The omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk.  We did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk.  Next, we turned our attention to performing a Kocher maneuver.  This was done and the stomach was freed up.  We took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm.  We enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.  We also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.  The esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.  We next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.  The left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.  We first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.  The left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.  At this point the stomach was freely mobile.  We then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.  A 2-0 Vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz.  We then used Bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.  We placed a 16-French red rubber catheter through this site.  We tied down in place.  We then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a Witzel.  Next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties.  After doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen.  This was done with #1 Prolene.  We put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.,Next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure.  The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  The right chest was prepped and draped appropriately.  We then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We placed standard chest retractors.  Next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus.  We dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.  The azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties.  As mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus.  After doing this, we backed our NG tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring.  We used an automatic pursestring and applied.  We then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with Metzenbaum scissors.  We secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.  The pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.  Next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 GIA stapler.  After doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using Bovie electrocautery.  We placed our EEA stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.  We connected our anvil to the EEA stapler.  This was then secured appropriately.  We checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.  We then fired the stapler.  We obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology.  We also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.  Of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.  We then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.  This was closed with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  We then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  We returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.  Next, we placed two #28-French chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis.  We then closed the chest with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The lung was brought up.  We closed the muscle layers with #0 Vicryl followed by #0 Vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the ICU in good condition.",Gastroenterology
4781,"PROCEDURE: , Left heart catheterization, left and right coronary angiography, left ventricular angiography, and intercoronary stenting of the right coronary artery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the Catheterization Laboratory.  After informed consent, he was medicated with Versed and fentanyl.  The right groin was prepped and draped, and infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine.  Percutaneously, #6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Selective native left and right coronary angiography was performed followed by left ventricular angiography.  The patient had a totally occluded right coronary.  We initially started with a JR4 guide.  We were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis.  We were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated.  We then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis, but we had very little guide support, the guide kept coming out.  We then switched to an AL1 guide and that too did not enable us to get anything to cross this lesion.  We finally had to go an AL2 guide, we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection.  That guided seated, we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis, and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip.  The surgeons were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open, but we were able to re-cross with a sport wire.  We then re-dilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support, we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm Vision stent, where the lesion was and post-dilated it to 18 atmospheres.  Routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded, whether this was from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis was unclear, but we were able to re-wire that area and get a 25 x12 Vision balloon and dilate the area and re-establish flow to the small segment.  We then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm Vision stent at 18 atmospheres.  Final angiography showed resolution of the dissection.  We could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent.  No perforation and excellent flow.  During the intervention, we did give a bolus and drip of Angiomax.  At the end of the procedure, we stopped the Angiomax and gave 600 mg of Plavix.  We did a right femoral angiogram; however, the Angio-Seal plug could not take, so we used manual pressure and a Femostop.  We transported the patient to his room in stable condition.,ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA:,  Left main coronary is normal.  Left anterior descending artery has a fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60% stenosis of the LAD before it bifurcates into diagonal.  The diagonal does appear to have about 50% osteal stenosis.  There is a lot of plaquing further down the diagonal, but good flow.  The rest of the LAD looked good pass the proximal 60% stenosis and after the diagonal branch.  Circumflex artery was nondominant vessel, consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel.  The first obtuse marginal had a long 50% narrowing and then the AV groove branch was free of any disease.  Some mild collaterals to the right were seen.  Right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary, just about 0.5 cm after its origin.  After we got a wire across the area of occlusion, we could see some thrombosis and a 99% stenosis just at the curve.  Following the balloon angioplasty, we established good flow down the distal vessel.  We still had about residual 70% stenosis.  When we had to go back with the AL2 guide, we could see a little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused a little bit of intimal dissection.  We re-dilated and then deployed.  Repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally.  We never did have the wire that far down, so this was probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus.  After deploying the stent, we had total resolution of the original lesion.  We then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch, which the remainder of the vessel was patent giving off a large PDA.  The posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in its mid portion.  We got a wire through and dilated this.  We then came back and put a second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent.  Repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection, a little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in a little subintimal pouch, but this was excluded by the stent.  There were no filling defects in the stent and excellent flow.  The distal posterolateral branch did open up, although it was little under-filled and there may have been some mild residual disease there.,IMPRESSION: , Atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary, successfully stented to zero residual with repair of a small proximal dissection.  Minor distal disease of the posterolateral branch and 60% proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50% diagonal stenosis along with 50% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

Anterior instrumentation for stabilization by Slim-LOC plate C4, C5, C6, and C7 (22846); with intraoperative x-ray times two.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,SERVICE: , Neurosurgery.,OPERATION: , The patient was brought into the operating room, placed in a supine position where general anesthesia was administered.  Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner, and then the prevertebral space was encountered and prominent anterior osteophytes were well visualized once longus colli muscle was cauterized along its mesial border, and self-retaining retractors were placed to reveal the anterior osteophytic spaces.  Large osteophytes were excised with a rongeur at C4-5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 revealing a collapsed disc space and a #11 blade was utilized to create an annulotomy at all three interspaces with discectomies being performed with straight disc forceps removing grossly degenerated and very degenerated discs at C4-C5, then at C5-C6, then at C6-C7 sending specimen for permanent section to Pathology in a routine and separate manner.  Residual disc fragments were drilled away as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements in order to perform a wide decompression all the way posteriorly to the spinal canal itself finally revealing a ligament, which was removed in a similar piecemeal fashion with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs also utilizing these instruments to remove prominent osteophytes, widely laterally bilaterally at each interspace with one at C4-C5, more right-sided.  The most prominent osteophyte and compression was at C5-C6 followed by C6-C7 and C4-C5 with a complete decompression of the spinal canal allowing the dura to finally bulge into the interspace at all three levels, once the ligaments were proximally removed as well and similarly a sign of a decompressed status.  The nerve roots themselves were inspected with a double ball dissector and found to be equally decompressed.  The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently irrigated away.  Appropriate size Bengal cages were filled with the patient's own bone elements and countersunk into position, filled along with fusion putty, and once these were quite tightly applied and checked, further stability was added by the placement of a Slim-LOC plate of appropriate size with appropriate size screws, and a post placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements.,The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution again and inspected, and hemostasis was completely achieved and finally the wound was closed in a routine closure by approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was sterilely dressed, and incorporated a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in a routine fashion.

1800,"REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt ""just like the stroke.""  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing ""mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,"" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it ""every other night.""  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times ""snoring"" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.,SUBSTANCE USE:,  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  She used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but quit five to six years ago.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , Ms. A had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  She reported that her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer.  Her father has gout and blood clots.  Siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and GI tumors.  She was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Ms. A completed high school degree.  She reported that she primarily obtained B's and C's in school.  She received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity.,She currently works for the Social Security Administration in data processing.  As mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition.  She is now living on her own.  She has never driven.  She reported that she continues to perform ADLs independently such as cooking and cleaning.  She lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters.  She previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation.  She also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away.  She has returned to activities she enjoys such as quire, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the Bahamas at the end of October.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , Ms. A did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  She reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events.  She reported that this only ""comes and goes."",TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II),  Token Test,  Sentence Repetition,  Visual Naming,  Controlled Oral Word Association,  Spelling Test,  Aural Comprehension,  Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test",Psychiatry / Psychology

I will give her prescription for ciprofloxacin that she can take for 3 days presumptively and I have discharged her home with omeprazole and Colace to take over-the-counter for constipation and we will send her home with Percocet for pain.  Her labs were within normal limits.  She did have an elevated white blood cell count, but I believe this is just leukemoid reaction, but she is afebrile, and if she does have UTI, may also be related.  Her labs in terms of her bilirubin were within normal limits.  Her LFTs were slightly elevated, I do believe this is related to the cautery used on the liver bed.  They were 51 and 83 for the AST and ALT respectively.

1302,"SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today with his mom for checkup.  He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the ""bad crowd"" and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.  Medications, he takes no medications regularly.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight is 164 pounds, blood pressure 108/60, pulse 88, respirations 16, and temperature was not taken.  General:  He is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  Psychiatric:  Alert and oriented times 3.  Skin:  I examined his upper extremities.  He showed me his injection sites.  I can see marks, but they seem to be healing up nicely.  I do not see any evidence of cellulitis.  There is no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis.,ASSESSMENT: , Substance abuse.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with the patient and his mom.  I am not prescribing him any narcotics or controlled substances.  I am not in the practice of trading one addiction for another.  It has been one week without any sort of drugs at all.  I do not think he needs weaning.  I think right now it is mostly psychological, although there still could be some residual physical addiction.  However, once again I do not believe it to be necessary to prescribe him any sort of controlled substance at the present time.  I do believe that his depression needs to be treated.  I gave him fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet daily.  I discussed the side effects in detail.  I did also warn him that all antidepressant medications carry an increased risk of suicide.  If he should start to feel any of these symptoms, he should call #911 or go to the emergency room immediately.  If he has any problems or side effects, he was also directed to call me here at the office.  After-hours, he can go to the emergency room or call #911.  I am going to see him back in three weeks for the depression.  I gave him the name and phone number of Behavioral Health and I told him to call so that he can get into rehabilitation program or at least a support group.  We are unable to make a referral for him to do that.  He has to call on his own.  He has no insurance.  However, I think fluoxetine is very affordable.  He can get it for $4 per month at Wal-Mart.  His mom is going to keep an eye on him as well.  He is going to be staying there.  It sounds like he is looking for a job.",SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes

These dense adhesions were associated with chronic inflammatory edematous changes.  The cystic duct was easily identifiable and seen entering into the gallbladder and clipped two proximally and one distally.  The cystic artery was an anomalous branch that was anterior to the cystic duct and was identified, clipped with two clips proximally and one distally.  The remainder of the evaluation of the abdomen revealed no evidence of nodularity or masses in the liver.  There was no evidence of adhesions from the abdominal wall to the liver.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,This is a 17-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 08/20/2003 with complaints of intractable right upper quadrant abdominal pain.  She had been asked to follow up and scheduled for surgery previously.  Her pain had now been intractable associated with anorexia.  She was noted on physical examination to be afebrile; however, she was having severe right upper quadrant pain with examination as well as a Murphy's sign and voluntary guarding with examination.  Her transaminases were markedly elevated.  She also developed pancreatitis secondary to gallstones.  Her common bile duct was dilated to 1 cm with no evidence of wall thickening, but evidence of cholelithiasis.  She was seen by the gastroenterologist and underwent a sphincterotomy with balloon extraction of gallstones secondary to choledocholithiasis.  Following this, she was scheduled for operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Her parents were explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure.  She gave us informed consent to proceed with surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  Preoperatively, the patient received IV antibiotics of Ancef, sequential compression devices and subcutaneous heparin.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing a #15 blade scalpel, a transverse infraumbilical incision was created.  Utilizing a Veress needle with anterior traction on the anterior abdominal wall with a towel clamp, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Hanging water drop test was performed with notable air aspiration through the Veress needle and the saline passed through the Veress needle without difficulty.  The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg with carbon-dioxide.  Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a #10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  Video laparoscope was inserted and the above notable findings were identified in the operative findings.  The patient to proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy was decided and a subxiphoid port was placed.  A #15 bladed scalpel was used to make a transverse incision in the subxiphoid region within the midline.  The trocar was then inserted into the abdomen under direct visualization with the video laparoscope and seen to go to the right of falciform ligament.  Next, two 5 mm trocars were inserted under direct visualization, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior midaxillary line.  These were inserted without difficulty.  The liver edge was lifted and revealed a markedly edematous gallbladder with severe omental adhesions encapsulating the gallbladder.  Utilizing Endoshears scissor, a plane was created circumferentially to the dome of the gallbladder to allow assistance and dissection of these dense adhesions.  Next, the omental adhesions adjacent to the infundibulum were taken down and allowed to expose the cystic duct.  A small vessel was seen anterior to the cystic duct and this was clipped two proximally and one distally and noted to be an anomalous arterial branch.  This was transected with Endoshears scissor and visualized the pulsatile branch with two clips securely in place.  Next, the cystic duct was carefully dissected with Maryland dissectors and was visualized clearly both anterior and posteriorly.  Endoclips were placed two proximally and one distally and then the cystic duct was transected with Endoshears scissor.,Once the clips were noted to be in place, utilizing electrocautery another Dorsey dissector was used to carefully dissect the gallbladder off the liver bed wall.  The gallbladder was removed and the bleeding from the gallbladder wall was easily controlled with electrocautery.  The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  The gallbladder was grasped with a gallbladder grasper and removed from the subxiphoid port.  There was noted to be gallstones within the gallbladder.  Once the abdomen was re-insufflated after removing the gallbladder and copious irrigation was performed, all ports were then removed under direct visualization with no evidence of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall.  Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, a figure-of-eight was placed to the subxiphoid and infraumbilical fascia and this was approximated without difficulty.  The subxiphoid port was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline prior to closure of the fascia.  A #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate all incisions.  The incisions were then injected with local injectable 0.25% Marcaine.  All ports were then cleaned dry.  Steri-Strips were placed across and sterile pressure dressings were placed on top of this.  The patient tolerated the entire procedure well.  She was transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  She will be followed closely in the postoperative course in General Medical Floor.",Surgery

The patient had the risks and benefits of surgery discussed.  After discussion, the patient decided to proceed and the consent was signed.,On the day of surgery, the patient was taken from the holding area to the operating suite by the anesthesiologist and monitors were placed.  Following this, the patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  After this, a lid speculum was placed, preservative-free lidocaine drops were placed, and the SuperSharp blade was used to make an anterior chamber paracentesis.  Preservative-free lidocaine was instilled into the anterior chamber, and then Viscoat was instilled into the eye.,The 3.0 diamond keratome was then used to make a clear corneal temporal incision.  Following this, the cystotome was used to make a continuous tear-type capsulotomy.  After this, BSS was used to hydrodissect and hydrodelineate the lens.  The phacoemulsification unit was used to remove the cataract.  The I&A unit was used to remove the residual cortical material.  Following this, Provisc was used to inflate the bag.  The lens, a model SA60AT of ABCD diopters, serial #1234, was inserted into the bag and rotated into position using the Lester pusher.,After this, the residual Provisc was removed.  Michol was instilled and then the corneal wound was hydrated with BSS, and the wound was found to be watertight.  The lid speculum was removed.  Acular and Vigamox drops were placed.

She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.,GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY: , She does not bleed.  She has both ovaries, as well as her uterus and cervix.

Gynecological examination is unremarkable for her age.,PLAN:,  We discussed at length, the issue of sleep apnea and its negative sequela.  I have recommended that she be referred for a sleep study.  She is certainly at risk for sleep apnea.  She refuses this.  I do not think that her upper respiratory tract infection needs any further treatment at this time since she is feeling better.  I did x-ray her knee and with the exception of some degenerative changes, it was unremarkable.  I reviewed this with her.  I do think that since she is having rectal bleeding, while this is not real unusual for her, with her family history of colon cancer, I am going to have her discuss this further with Dr. XYZ and leave further studies up to them.  I will dictate Dr. XYZ a note.  I am not going to order any further studies at this time in terms of her yellow stools and right upper quadrant discomfort.  She has had a gallbladder sonogram done in the past, this has been unremarkable and these symptoms really have not changed for her.  This however, has been some time ago.  I suspect she has an element of irritable bowel syndrome.  I have strongly encouraged weight reduction, both through diet and exercise.  I would like to see her back in the office in six months.  I did retake her blood pressure today and it was 130/70.  She is fasting this morning, so we will get a fasting blood sugar, chem-12, lipid profile, and CPK.  I will her mail the results.  I have strongly encouraged medication management if her lipids are elevated.  I think she is amenable to this.  Her DEXA scan is up to date having been done on 04/09/03.

Risks explained as bleeding, infection, bowel perforation, aspiration pneumonia, or reaction to the medications.  Vital signs were monitored by blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.  Supplemental O2 given.  Specifics discussed.  Preprocedure physical exam performed.  Stable vital signs.  Lungs clear.  Cardiac exam showed regular rhythm.  Abdomen soft.  Her past history, her past workup, her past visitation with me for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, well responsive to sulfasalazine reviewed.  She currently has a flare and is not responding, therefore, likely may require steroid taper.  At the same token, her symptoms are mild.  She has rectal bleeding, essentially only some rusty stools.  There is not significant diarrhea, just some lower stools.  No significant pain.  Therefore, it is possible that we are just dealing with a hemorrhoidal bleed, therefore, colonoscopy now needed.  Past history reviewed.  Specifics of workup, need for followup, and similar discussed.  All questions answered.,A normal digital rectal examination was performed.  The PCF-160 AL was inserted into the anus and advanced to the cecum without difficulty, as identified by the ileocecal valve, cecal stump, and appendical orifice.  All mucosal aspects thoroughly inspected, including a retroflexed examination.  Withdrawal time was greater than six minutes.  Unfortunately, the terminal ileum could not be intubated despite multiple attempts.,Findings were those of a normal cecum, right colon, transverse colon, descending colon.  A small cecal polyp was noted, this was biopsy-removed, placed in bottle #1.  Random biopsies from the cecum obtained, bottle #2; random biopsies from the transverse colon obtained, as well as descending colon obtained, bottle #3.  There was an area of inflammation in the proximal sigmoid colon, which was biopsied, placed in bottle #4.  There was an area of relative sparing, with normal sigmoid lining, placed in bottle #5, randomly biopsied, and then inflammation again in the distal sigmoid colon and rectum biopsied, bottle #6, suggesting that we may be dealing with Crohn disease, given the relative sparing of the sigmoid colon and junk lesion.

Note that previously the patient was found to have some baseline dementia, although slight.  The patient was seen and evaluated by the neurology team, who cleared the patient for surgery.  The patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We first began our dissection by using a #10-blade scalpel to incise the skin over the femoral artery in the groin bilaterally.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the femoral vessels using Bovie electrocautery.  The common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoris arteries were encircled and dissected out peripherally.  Vessel loops were placed around the aforementioned arteries.  After doing so, we turned our attention to beginning our abdominal dissection.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline laparotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the fascia using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened and an Omni retractor was positioned.  The aorta was dissected out in the abdomen.  The left femoral vein was identified.  There was a nicely clampable portion of aorta visible.  We, as mentioned, placed our Omni retractor and then turned our attention to performing our anastomosis.  Full-dose heparin was given.  Next, vascular clamps were applied to the iliac vessels as well as to the proximal aorta just below the renal vessels.  A #11-blade scalpel was used to make an arteriotomy in the aorta, which was lengthened both proximally and distally using Potts scissors.  We then beveled our proximal graft and constructed an end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed our graft and noted there was no evidence of a leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We then created our tunnels over the iliac vessels.  We pulled the distal limbs over our ABF graft into the groin.  We then proceeded to perform our right anastomosis first.  We applied vascular clamps on the proximal common femoral, profunda, and superficial femoral arteries.  We incised the common femoral artery and lengthened our arteriotomy in the vessel both proximally and distally.  We then footed the graft down onto the common femoral artery to the level of the SFA and constructed our anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed the common femoral, SFA, and profunda femoris arteries.  We then removed our clamp.  We opened the limb more proximally in the abdomen on the right side.  We then turned our attention to the left side and similarly placed our vascular clamps.  We used a #11-blade scalpel to make an arteriotomy in the vessel.  We then lengthened our arteriotomy both proximally and distally again onto the SFA.  We constructed a footed end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we opened our clamps.  There was no noticeable leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We checked our proximal graft to aortic anastomosis, which was noted to be in good condition.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  We closed the peritoneum over the graft with 4-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The abdomen was closed with #1 nylon in a running fashion.  The skin was closed with subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at end of case.

3213,"SUBJECTIVE: , This patient presents to the office today with his mom for checkup.  He used to live in the city.  He used to go to college down in the city.  He got addicted to drugs.  He decided it would be a good idea to get away from the ""bad crowd"" and come up and live with his mom.  He has a history of doing heroin.  He was injecting into his vein.  He was seeing a physician in the city.  They were prescribing methadone for some time.  He says that did help.  He was on 10 mg of methadone.  He was on it for three to four months.  He tried to wean down on the methadone a couple of different times, but failed.  He has been intermittently using heroin.  He says one of the big problems is that he lives in a household full of drug users and he could not get away from it.  All that changed now that he is living with his mom.  The last time he did heroin was about seven to eight days ago.  He has not had any methadone in about a week either.  He is coming in today specifically requesting methadone.  He also admits to being depressed.  He is sad a lot and down.  He does not have much energy.  He does not have the enthusiasm.  He denies any suicidal or homicidal ideations at the present time.  I questioned him on the symptoms of bipolar disorder and he does not seem to have those symptoms.  His past medical history is significant for no medical problems.  Surgical history, he voluntarily donated his left kidney.  Family and social history were reviewed per the nursing notes.  His allergies are no known drug allergies.

I can see marks, but they seem to be healing up nicely.  I do not see any evidence of cellulitis.  There is no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis.,ASSESSMENT: , Substance abuse.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with the patient and his mom.  I am not prescribing him any narcotics or controlled substances.  I am not in the practice of trading one addiction for another.  It has been one week without any sort of drugs at all.  I do not think he needs weaning.  I think right now it is mostly psychological, although there still could be some residual physical addiction.  However, once again I do not believe it to be necessary to prescribe him any sort of controlled substance at the present time.  I do believe that his depression needs to be treated.  I gave him fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet daily.  I discussed the side effects in detail.  I did also warn him that all antidepressant medications carry an increased risk of suicide.  If he should start to feel any of these symptoms, he should call #911 or go to the emergency room immediately.  If he has any problems or side effects, he was also directed to call me here at the office.  After-hours, he can go to the emergency room or call #911.  I am going to see him back in three weeks for the depression.  I gave him the name and phone number of Behavioral Health and I told him to call so that he can get into rehabilitation program or at least a support group.  We are unable to make a referral for him to do that.  He has to call on his own.  He has no insurance.  However, I think fluoxetine is very affordable.  He can get it for $4 per month at Wal-Mart.

He says he is having a lot of palpitations.  He gets a fluttering feeling in his chest.  He has been very tired over two weeks as well.  His job has been really getting to him.  He has been feeling nervous and anxious.  It seems like when he is feeling stressed he has more palpitations, sometimes they cause chest pain.  These symptoms are not triggered by exertion.  He had similar symptoms about 9 or 10 years ago.  At that time he went through a full workup.  Everything ended up being negative and they gave him something that he took for his nerves and he says that helped.  Unfortunately, he does not remember what it was.  Also over the last three days he has had some intestinal problems.  He has had some intermittent nausea and his stools have been loose.  He has been having some really funny green color to his bowel movements.  There has been no blood in the stool.  He is not having any abdominal pain, just some nausea.  He does not have much of an appetite.  He is a nonsmoker.,OBJECTIVE: , His weight today is 168.4 pounds, blood pressure 142/76, temperature 97.7, pulse 68, and respirations 16.  General exam:  The patient is nontoxic and in no acute distress.  There is no labored breathing.  Psychiatric:  He is alert and oriented times 3.  Ears:  Tympanic membranes pearly gray bilaterally.  Mouth:  No erythema, ulcers, vesicles, or exudate noted.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light bilaterally.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Extremities:  No edema, cyanosis, or clubbing.,ASSESSMENT:  ,1.  Palpitations, possibly related to anxiety.,2.  Fatigue.,3.  Loose stools with some green color and also some nausea.  There has been no vomiting, possibly a touch of gastroenteritis going on here.,PLAN: , The patient admits he has been putting this off now for about two weeks.  He says his work is definitely contributing to some of his symptoms and he feels stressed.  He is leaving for a vacation very soon.  Unfortunately, he is actually leaving Wednesday for XYZ, which puts us into a bit of a bind in terms of doing testing on him.  My overall opinion is he has some anxiety related issues and he may also have a touch of gastroenteritis.  A 12-lead EKG was performed on him in the office today.  This EKG was compared with the previous EKG contained in the chart from 2006 and I see that these EKGs look very similar with no significant changes noted, which is definitely a good news.  I am going to send him to the lab from our office to get the following tests done:  Comprehensive metabolic profile, CBC, urinalysis with reflex to culture and we will also get a chest X-ray.  Tomorrow morning I will manage to schedule him for an exercise stress test at Bad Axe Hospital.  We were able to squeeze him in.  His appointment is at 8:15 in the morning.  He is going to have the stress test done in the morning and he will come back to the office in the afternoon for recheck.  I am not going to be here so he is going to see Dr. X.  Dr. X should hopefully be able to call over and speak with the physician who attended the stress test and get a preliminary result before he leaves for XYZ.  Certainly, if something comes up we may need to postpone his trip.  We petitioned his medical records from his former physician and with luck we will be able to find out what medication he was on about nine or ten years ago.  In the meantime I have given him Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet two to three times a day as needed for anxiety.  I talked about Ativan, how it works.  I talked about the side effects.  I told him to use it only as needed and we can see how he is doing tomorrow when he comes back for his recheck.  I took him off of work today and tomorrow so he could rest.",SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes

She was placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without difficulty.  In the holding area, her allergies were reviewed.  It is unclear whether she is actually allergic to penicillin.  Codeine caused her to be excitable, but she did not actually have an allergic reaction to codeine.  She might be allergic to BACTRIM and SULFA.  After positioning a small shoulder roll and draping sterilely, McIvor mouthgag, #3 blade was inserted and suspended from the Mayo stand.  There was no bifid uvula or submucous cleft.  She had 3+ cryptic tonsils with significant debris in the tonsillar crypts.  Injection at each peritonsillar area with 0.25% with Marcaine with 1:200,000 Epinephrine, approximately 1.5 mL total volume.  The left superior tonsillar pole was then grasped with curved Allis forceps.  _______ incision and dissection in the tonsillar capsule and hemostasis and removal of the tonsil was obtained with Coblation Evac Xtra Wand on 7/3.  Mouthgag was released, reopened, no bleeding was seen.  The right tonsil was then removed in the same fashion.  The mouthgag released, reopened, and no bleeding was seen.  Small red rubber catheter in the nasal passage was used to retract the soft palate.  She had mild-to-moderate adenoidal tissue residual.  It was removed with Coblation Evac Xtra gently curved Wand on 9/5.  Red rubber catheter was then removed.  Mouthgag was again released, reopened, no bleeding was seen.  Orogastric suction carried out with only scant clear stomach contents.  Mouthgag was then removed.  Teeth and lips were inspected and were in their preoperative condition.  The patient then awakened, extubated, and taken to recovery room in good condition.,TOTAL BLOOD LOSS FROM TONSILLECTOMY: , Less than 2 mL.,TOTAL BLOOD LOSS FROM ADENOIDECTOMY: , Less than 2 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , No intraoperative events or complications occurred.,PLAN:,  Family will be counseled postoperatively.

2444,"BLEPHAROPLASTY,The patient was prepped and draped.  The upper lid skin was marked out in a lazy S fashion, and the redundant skin marked out with a Green forceps.  Then the upper lids were injected with 2% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine and 1 mL of Wydase per 20 mL of solution.,The upper lid skin was then excised within the markings.  Gentle pressure was placed on the upper eyelids, and the fat in each of the compartments was teased out using a scissor and cotton applicator; and then the fat was cross clamped, cut, and the clamp cauterized.  This was done in the all compartments of the middle and medial compartments of the upper eyelid, and then the skin sutured with interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures.  The first suture was placed in the lower eyelid skin picking up the periorbital muscle and then the upper portion of the tarsus and then the upper lid skin.  This created a significant crisp, supratarsal fold.  The upper lid skin was closed in this fashion, and then attention was turned to the lower lid.,An incision was made under the lash line and slightly onto the lateral canthus.  The #15 blade was used to delineate the plane in the lateral portion of the incision, and then using a scissor the skin was cut at the marking.  Then the skin muscle flap was elevated with sharp dissection.  The fat was located and using a scissor the three eyelid compartments were opened.  Fat was teased out, cross clamped, the fat removed, and then the clamp cauterized.  Once this was done the skin was tailored to the lower lid incision site with mouth open and eyes in upward gaze, and then the excess skin removed.  The suture line was sutured with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures.  Once this was done the procedure was finished.,The patient left the OR in satisfactory condition.  The patient was given 50 mg of Demerol IM with 25 mg of Phenergan.",Ophthalmology

4743,"CLINICAL HISTORY:,  A 48-year-old smoker found to have a right upper lobe mass on chest x-ray and is being evaluated for chest pain.  PET scan demonstrated a mass in the right upper lobe and also a mass in the right lower lobe, which were also identified by CT scan.  The lower lobe mass was approximately 1 cm in diameter and the upper lobe mass was 4 cm to 5 cm in diameter.  The patient was referred for surgical treatment.,SPECIMEN:,A.  Lung, wedge biopsy right lower lobe,B.  Lung, resection right upper lobe,C.  Lymph node, biopsy level 2 and 4,D.  Lymph node, biopsy level 7 subcarinal,FINAL DIAGNOSIS:,A.  Wedge biopsy of right lower lobe showing:  Adenocarcinoma, Grade 2, Measuring 1 cm in diameter with invasion of the overlying pleura and with free resection margin.,B.  Right upper lobe lung resection showing:  Adenocarcinoma, grade 2, measuring 4 cm in diameter with invasion of the overlying pleura and with free bronchial margin.  Two (2) hilar lymph nodes with no metastatic tumor.,C.  Lymph node biopsy at level 2 and 4 showing seven (7) lymph nodes with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor.,D.  Lymph node biopsy, level 7 subcarinal showing (5) lymph nodes with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor.,COMMENT:  ,The morphology of the tumor seen in both lobes is similar and we feel that the smaller tumor involving the right lower lobe is most likely secondary to transbronchial spread from the main tumor involving the right upper lobe.  This suggestion is supported by the fact that no obvious vascular or lymphatic invasion is demonstrated and adjacent to the smaller tumor, there is isolated nests of tumor cells within the air spaces.  Furthermore, immunoperoxidase stain for Ck-7, CK-20 and TTF are performed on both the right lower and right upper lobe nodule.  The immunohistochemical results confirm the lung origin of both tumors and we feel that the tumor involving the right lower lobe is due to transbronchial spread from the larger tumor nodule involving the right upper lobe.,",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

3285,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild aortic stenosis, and previously moderate mitral regurgitation although not seen recently and I was asked to perform cardiology consultation for her because there was concern for atrial fibrillation after a fall.  Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.  She does recall having palpitations because of the pain after the fall, but she states she is not having them since and has not had them prior.  She denies any chest pain nor shortness of breath prior to or since the fall.  She states clearly she can walk and she would be able to climb 2 flights of stairs without problems.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , She is followed by Dr. X in our office and has a history of severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild elevation and PA pressure.  On 05/12/08, preserved left and right ventricular systolic function, aortic sclerosis with apparent mild aortic stenosis, and bi-atrial enlargement.  She has previously had a Persantine Myoview nuclear rest-stress test scan completed at ABCD Medical Center in 07/06 that was negative.  She has had significant mitral valve regurgitation in the past being moderate, but on the most recent echocardiogram on 05/12/08, that was not felt to be significant.  She has a history of hypertension and EKGs in our office show normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs versus wandering atrial pacemaker.  She does have a history of significant hypertension in the past.  She has had dizzy spells and denies clearly any true syncope.  She has had bradycardia in the past from beta-blocker therapy.,MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:,1.  Multivitamin p.o. daily.,2.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.,3.  Lisinopril 40 mg once a day.,4.

IT IS LISTED THAT TOPROL HAS CAUSED SHORTNESS OF BREATH IN HER OFFICE CHART AND I BELIEVE SHE HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT BRADYCARDIA WITH THAT IN THE PAST.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  She states her brother died of an MI suddenly in his 50s.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, nor use any illicit drugs.  She is retired from Morse Chain and delivering newspapers.  She is widowed.  She lives alone but has family members who live either on her property or adjacent to it.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding, stomach ulcers.  She does not recall renal calculi, nor cholelithiasis, denies asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, sleep apnea, home oxygen use.  She does note occasional peripheral edema.  She is not aware of prior history of MI.  She denies diabetes.  She does have a history of GERD.  She notes feeling depressed at times because of living alone.  She denies rheumatologic conditions including psoriasis or lupus.  Remainder of review of systems is negative times 15 except as described above.,PHYSICAL EXAM:  ,Height 5 feet 0 inches, weight 123 pounds, temperature 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure has ranged from 160/87 with pulses recorded at being 144, and currently ranges 101/53 to 147/71, pulse 64, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 97%.  On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing, but is alert and interactive.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is  normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins were not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes.  She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2, regular rate, frequent ectopic beats, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, preserved aortic component of the second heart sound.  There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard.  There is no rub or gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities without significant clubbing, cyanosis, and there is trivial to 1+ peripheral edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  Affect is appropriate.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA: , Pertinent labs include chest x-ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob.  No clear pulmonary vascular congestion.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7, it was 3.1 on admission, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 150, magnesium was 2 on 07/13/06.  Troponin was 0.03 followed by 0.18.  INR is 0.93, white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 36, platelet count 115,000.,EKGs are reviewed.  Initial EKG done on 08/19/08 at 1832 shows MAT, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, no ischemic changes.  She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.,IMPRESSION:  ,She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist.",General Medicine

The patient has been followed regularly by myself and Dr. X and has been continuously free of diseases since that time.  In that interval, he had a coronary artery bypass graft and was taken off of Plavix.  Most recently, he had a PET CT, which showed new right hydronephrosis and a followup cystoscopy, which showed a new abnormality in the right side of his bladder where he previously had the tumor resected and treated.  I took him to the operating room and extensively resected this area with findings of a high-grade muscle invasive bladder cancer.  We could not identify the right ureteral orifice, and he had a right ureteral stent placed.  Metastatic workup was negative and Cardiology felt he was at satisfactory medical risk for surgery and he was taken to the operating room this time for planned salvage cystoprostatectomy.  He was interested in orthotopic neobladder, and I felt like that would be reasonable if resecting around the urethra indicated the tissue was healthier.  Therefore, we planned on an Indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,On exploration, there were multiple abnormalities outside the bladder as follows:  There were at least three small lesions within the distal small bowel, the predominant one measured about 1.5 cm in diameter with a white scar on the surface.  There were two much smaller lesions also with a small white scar, with very little palpable mass.  The larger of the two was resected and found to be a carcinoid tumor.  There also were changes in the small bowel mesentry that looked inflammatory and biopsies of this showed only fibrous tissue and histiocytes.  The small bowel mesentry was fairly thickened at the base, but no discrete abnormality noted.,Both common iliac and lymph node samples were very thickened and indurated, and frozen section of the left showed cancer cells that were somewhat degenerative suggesting a chemotherapy and radiation therapy effect; viability was unable to be determined.  There was a frozen section of the distal right external iliac lymph node that was negative.  The bladder was very thickened and abnormal suggesting extensive cancer penetrating just under the peritoneal surface.  The bladder was fairly stuck to the pelvic sidewall and anterior symphysis pubis requiring very meticulous resection in order to get it off of these structures.  The external iliac lymph nodes were resected on both sides of the obturator; the lymph packet, however, was very stuck and adherent to the pelvic sidewall, and I elected not to remove that.  The rest of the large bowel appeared normal.  There were no masses in the liver, and the gallbladder was surgically absent.  There was nasogastric tube in the stomach.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operative suite, and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, having placed in the supine position and flexed over the anterior superior iliac spine, his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The radiologist placed a radial arterial line and an intravenous catheter.  Intravenous antibiotics were given for prophylaxis.  We made a generous midline skin incision from high end of the epigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deepened through the rectus fascia, and the rectus muscles separated in the midline.  Exploration was carried out with the findings described.  The bladder was adherent and did appear immobile.  Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor was placed for exposure.  We began by assessing the small and large bowel with the findings in the small bowel as described.  We subsequently resected the largest of the lesions by exogenous wedge resection and reanastomosed the small bowel with a two-layer running 4-0 Prolene suture.  We then mobilized the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure after incising the white line of Toldt and mobilized the terminal ileal mesentery up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  The ureters were carefully dissected out and down deep in the true pelvis.  The right ureter was thickened and hydronephrotic with a stent in place and the left was of normal caliber.  I kept the ureters intact until we were moving the bladder off as described above.  At that point, we then ligated the ureters with the RP-45 vascular load and divided it.,We then established the proximal ____________ laterally to both genitofemoral nerves and resected the precaval and periaortic lymph nodes.  The common iliac lymph nodes remained stuck to the ureter.  Frozen section with the findings described on the left.,I then began the dissection over the right external iliac artery and vein and had a great deal of difficulty dissecting distally.  I was, however, able to establish the distal plane of dissection and a large lymph node was present in the distal external iliac vessels.  Clips were used to control the lymphatics distally.  These lymph nodes were sent for frozen section, which was negative.  We made no attempt to circumferentially mobilize the vessels, but essentially, swept the tissue off of the anterior surface and towards the bladder and then removed it.  The obturator nerve on the right side was sucked into the pelvic sidewall, and I elected not to remove those.  On the left side, things were a little bit more mobile in terms of the lymph nodes, but still the obturator lymph nodes were left intact.,We then worked on the lateral pedicles on both sides and essentially determined that I can take these down.  I then mobilized the later half of the symphysis pubis and pubic ramus to get distal to the apical prostate.  At this point, I scrubbed out of the operation, talked to the family, and indicated that I felt the cystectomy was more palliative than therapeutic, and I reiterated his desire to be free of any external appliance.,I then proceeded to take down the lateral pedicles with an RP-45 stapler on the right and clips distally.  The endopelvic fascia was incised.  I then turned my attention posteriorly and incised the peritoneum overlying the anterior rectal wall and ramus very meticulously dissected the rectum away from the posterior Denonvilliers fascia.  I intentionally picked down those two pedicles lateral to the rectum between the clips and then turned my attention retropubically.  I was able to pass a 0 Vicryl suture along the dorsal venous complex, tied this, and then, sealed and divided the complex with a LigaSure and oversewed it distally with 2-0 Vicryl figure-of-eight stitch.  I then divided the urethra distal to the apex of the prostate, divided the Foley catheter between the clamps and then the posterior urethra.  I then was able to take down the remaining distal attachments of the apex and took the dissection off the rectum, and the specimen was then free of all attachments and handed off the operative field.  The bivalved prostate appeared normal.  We then carefully inspected the rectal wall and noted to be intact.  The wound was irrigated with 1 L of warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection made for hemostasis and a dry pack placed in the pelvis.,We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch.  I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler.  I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler.  We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60.  The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler.  The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic ""pop,"" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75.  Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures.,We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture.  The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,We then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  We left an 18-French Robinson through the stoma and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,The stoma was returned to the umbilicus after resecting the terminal ileum.,We then placed a large JP drain into both obturator fossae and brought it up the right lower quadrant.  Rectus fascia was closed with buried #2 Prolene stitch anchoring a new figure of 8 at each end tying the two stitches above and in the middle and underneath the fascia.  Interrupted stitches were placed as well.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and skin closed with surgical clips.  The estimated blood loss was 2500 mL.  The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells and 4 units of FFP.  The patient was then awakened, extubated, and taken on a stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.",Surgery

She saw her dentist in Sacaton before Thanksgiving who placed her on antibiotics and told her to return to the clinic for multiple teeth extractions.  The patient neglected to return to the dentist until this weekend for IV antibiotics and definitive treatment.  She noticed on Friday that her face was starting to swell up a little bit and it progressively got worse.  The patient was admitted to the hospital on Monday for IV antibiotics.  Oral surgery was consulted today to aid in the management of the increased facial swelling and tooth pain.  The patient was worked up preoperatively by anesthesia and Oromaxillary Facial Surgery.  It was determined that she would benefit from being having multiple teeth removed and drainage of the facial abscess under general anesthesia.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and laid on the operating room table on supine fashion.  ASA monitors were attached as stated.  General anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetic and maintained with a nasal endotracheal intubation and inhalation of anesthetics.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual oromaxillary facial surgery fashion.,An 18-gauze needle of 20 mL syringe was used to aspirate the pus out of the right buccal space.  This pus was then cultured and sent to micro lab for cultures and sensitivities.  Approximately 7 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:1000 epinephrine was injected in the maxillary vestibule and palate.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take affect a moist latex sponge was placed in the posterior oropharynx to throat pack throughout the case.  Mouth rinse was then poured into the oral cavity.  The mucosa was scrubbed with a tooth brush and peridex was evacuated with suction.  Using a #15 blade a clavicular incision from tooth #5 back to 1 with tuberosity release was performed.,A full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was developed and approximately 6 mL of pus was instantly drained from the buccal space.  It was noted on exam that the tooth #1 was fractured off to the gum line with gross decay.  Tooth #2, 3, 4, and 5 had pus leaking from the clavicular epithelium and had rampant decay on tooth #2 and 3 and some mobility on teeth #4 and 5.  It was decided that teeth #1 through 5 would be surgically removed to ensure that all potential teeth causing the abscess were removed.  Using a rongeur both buccal bone and the tooth 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were surgically removed.  The extraction sites were curetted with curettes and the bone was smoothed with the rongeur and the bone file.  Dissection was then carried further up in the canine space and the face was palpated extra orally from the temporalis muscle down to the infraorbital rim and more pus was expressed.  This site was then irrigated with copious amounts of sterile water.  There was still noted to be induration in the buccal mucosa so #15 blade was used anterior to Stensen duct.  A 2 cm incision was made and using a Hemostat blunt dissection in to the buccal mucosa was performed.  A little-to-no pus was received.  Using a half-inch Penrose the drain was placed up on the anterior border of the maxilla and zygoma and sutured in place with 2-0 Ethilon suture.  Remainder of the flap was left open to drain.  Further examination of the floor of mouth was soft.  The lateral pharynx was nonindurated or swollen.  At this point, the throat pack was removed and OG tube was placed and the stomach contents were evacuated.  The procedure was then determined to be over.  The patient was extubated, breathing spontaneously, and transferred to the PACU in excellent condition.",Dentistry

She has been anemic as well with no gross evidence of blood loss.  She has had a decreased appetite with weight loss greater than 20 lb over the past few months.  After discussion with the patient and her daughter, she was scheduled for EGD and colonoscopy for evaluation.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation.  When adequate level of sedation was achieved, a digital rectal exam was performed, which demonstrated no masses and no hemorrhoids.  The colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and air was insufflated.  The scope was coursed through the rectum and sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon to the level of the cecum.  There were no polyps, masses, diverticuli, or areas of inflammation.  The scope was then slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls.  Air was aspirated.  Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed.  There was no evidence of perianal disease.  No source of the anemia was identified.,Attention was then taken for performing an EGD.  The gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and was entered into the hypopharynx.  The esophagus was easily intubated and traversed.  There were no abnormalities of the esophagus.  The stomach was entered and was insufflated.  The scope was coursed along the greater curvature towards the antrum.  Adjacent to the pylorus, towards the anterior surface, was a mass like lesion with a central _______.  It was not clear if this represents a healing ulcer or neoplasm.  Several biopsies were taken.  The mass was soft.  The pylorus was then entered.  The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, or bleeding.  The scope was then brought back into the antrum and was retroflexed.  In the fundus and body, there was evidence of streaking and inflammation.  There were also several small sessile polyps, which were removed with biopsy forceps.  Biopsy was also taken for CLO.  A hiatal hernia was present as well.  Air was aspirated.  The scope was slowly withdrawn.  The GE junction was unremarkable.  The scope was fully withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  She will undergo a CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis to further assess any possible adenopathy or gastric obstructional changes.  We will await the biopsy reports and further recommendations will follow.",Gastroenterology

Placement of right external iliac artery catheter via left femoral approach.,2.  Arteriography of the right iliac arteries.,3.  Primary open angioplasty of the right iliac artery using an 8 mm diameter x 3 cm length angioplasty balloon.,3.  Open stent placement in the right external iliac artery for inadequate angiographic result of angioplasty alone.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with intravenous sedation.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:,  He is a 67-year-old white male who is well known to me.  He had severe peripheral vascular disease and recently underwent a kidney transplant.  He has had some troubles with increasing serum creatinine and hypertension.  Duplex suggests a high-grade iliac stenosis just proximal to his transplant kidney.  He is brought to the operating room for arteriography and potential treatment of this.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to operating room #14.  A condom catheter was put in place.  Preoperative antibiotics were administered.  The patient's left arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made over his brachial artery after anesthetizing the skin.  His brachial artery was dissected free and looped with vessel loops.  Under direct vision, it was punctured with an 18-gauge needle and a short 3J guidewire and 6-French sheath put in place.  A 3J guidewire was then introduced after the administration of intravenous heparin and advanced into the descending thoracic aorta.  This was then advanced down into the right common iliac artery.  The catheter was placed over this and arteriography performed.  After adjusting the image intensifier to unfold the origin of the renal artery from the iliac system.  We were able to demonstrate an approximately 60-70% stenosis of the external iliac artery.  Immediately preceding the origin of the artery for the transplant kidney, which appeared to be widely patent.  We elected to try and treat this.  With catheter support a magic torque guidewire was advanced through the stenosis and into the common femoral artery.  An 8 mm diameter x 3 cm length angioplasty balloon was positioned across the stenosis and inflated.  This inflation was held for one minute.  This was then deflated and a catheter positioned again in the proximal common iliac artery.  For this application, we used a guide catheter that would allow us to inject contrast without losing our wire purchase.  This showed an improvement in the stenosis, but a residual stenosis of at least 30% and we elected to stent this.  An 8 mm diameter x 3 cm length stent was chosen and placed just proximal to the origin of the renal artery.  After this was completed, the stent introduction balloon was removed and the catheter replaced.  Repeat angiography showed a widely patent segment with no evidence of any residual stenosis.  There was no evidence of any dissection or damage to the renal artery.  We interpreted this as satisfactory procedure.  Guidewires and sheaths were removed.  The brachial artery was repaired with two interrupted sutures of 7-0 Prolene.  The wound was irrigated and the subcutaneous tissue closed with a running suture of Vicryl.  The skin was reapproximated with a running intracuticular suture of Monocryl.  Steri-Strips and sterile occlusive dressing were applied and the patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Estimated blood loss for the procedure was less than 50 mL.  Total contrast employed was 37.5 mL.  Total fluoroscopy time was 12 minutes and 43 seconds.",Surgery

She has had some difficulty with her vision that has improved with her recent surgical procedure.  She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats.  She has had loose stools.  The rest of her review of systems is negative.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,VITALS:",Gastroenterology
4963,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Aortoiliac occlusive disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Aortoiliac occlusive disease.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:, Aortobifemoral bypass.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  The abdominal contents were within normal limits.  The aorta was of normal size and consistency consistent with arteriosclerosis.  A 16x8 mm Gore-Tex graft was placed without difficulty.  The femoral vessels were small somewhat thin and there was posterior packing, but satisfactory bypass was performed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in a supine position, and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution.  A longitudinal incision was made after a Betadine-coated drape was placed over the incisional area.  Longitudinal incision was made over each groin initially and carried down to the subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The common deep and superficial femoral arteries were exposed and then these incisions were covered with antibiotic soaked sponges.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen, where a longitudinal incision was made from the pubis xiphoid, carried down subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The abdomen was entered above the umbilicus and then this was extended with care inferiorly as the patient has undergone previous abdominal surgery.  Mild adhesions were lysed.  The omentum was freed.  The small and large intestine were run with no evidence of abnormalities.  The liver and gallbladder were within normal limits.  No abnormalities were noted.  At this point, the Bookwalter retractor was placed.  NG tube was placed in the stomach and placed on suction.  The intestines were gently packed intraabdominally and laterally.  The rest of the peritoneum was then opened.  The aorta was cleared, both proximally and distally.  The left iliac was completely occluded.  The right iliac was to be cleansed.  At this point, 5000 units of aqueous heparin was administered to allow take effect.  The aorta was then clamped below the renal arteries and opened in a longitudinal fashion.  A single lumbar was ligated with #3-0 Prolene.  The inferior mesenteric artery was occluded intraluminally and required no suture closure.  Care was taken to preserve collaterals.  The aorta was measured, and a 16 mm Gore-Tex graft was brought on the field and anastomosed to the proximal aorta using #3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Last stitch was tied.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The clamp was gradually removed and additional Prolene was placed in the right posterolateral aspect to obtain better hemostasis.  At this point, strong pulses were present within the graft.  The limbs were vented and irrigated.  Using bimanual technique, the retroperitoneal tunnels were developed immediately on top of the iliac arteries into the groin.  The grafts were then brought through these, care being taken to avoid twisting of the graft.  At this point, the right iliac was then ligated using #0 Vicryl and the clamp was removed.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The right common femoral artery was then clamped proximally and distally, opened with #11 blade extended with Potts scissors.  The graft was _____ and anastomosed to the artery using #5-0 Prolene in a continuous fashion with a stitch _______ running fashion.  Prior to tying the last stitch, the graft and artery were vented and the last stitch was tied.  Flow was initially restored proximally then distally with good results.  Attention was then turned to the left groin and the artery grafts were likewise exposed, cleared proximally and distally.  The artery was opened, extended with a Potts scissors and anastomosis was performed with #5-0 Prolene again with satisfactory hemostasis.  The last stitch was tied.  Strong pulses were present within the artery and graft itself.  At this point, 25 mg of protamine was administered.  The wounds were irrigated with antibiotic solution.  The groins were repacked.  Attention was then returned to the abdomen.  The retroperitoneal area and the anastomotic sites were checked for bleeding and none was present.  The shell of the aorta was closed over the proximal anastomosis and the retroperitoneum was then repaired over the remaining portions of the graft.  The intraabdominal contents were then allowed to resume their normal position.  There was no evidence of ischemia to the large or small bowel.  At this point, the omentum and stomach were repositioned.  The abdominal wall was closed in a running single layer fashion using #1 PDS.  The skin was closed with skin staples.  The groins were again irrigated, closed with #3-0 Vicryl and #4-0 undyed Vicryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient was then taken into the recovery room in satisfactory condition after tolerating the procedure well.  Sponges and instrument counts were correct.  Estimated blood loss 900 cc.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
3859,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , ICU management.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 43-year-old gentleman who presented from an outside hospital with complaints of right upper quadrant pain in the abdomen, which revealed possible portal vein and superior mesenteric vein thrombus leading to mesenteric ischemia.  The patient was transferred to the ABCD Hospital where he had a weeklong course with progressive improvement in his status after aggressive care including intubation, fluid resuscitation, and watchful waiting.  The patient clinically improved; however, his white count remained elevated with the intermittent fevers prompting a CT scan.  Repeat CT scan showed a loculated area of ischemic bowel with perforation in the left upper abdomen.  The patient was taken emergently to the operating room last night by the General Surgery Service where proximal half of the jejunum was noted to be liquified with 3 perforations.  This section of small bowel was resected, and a wound VAC placed for damage control.  Plan was to return the patient to the Operating Room tomorrow for further exploration and possible re-anastomosis of the bowel.  The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and on pressors for septic shock and in the down ICU.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Prior to coming into the hospital for this current episode, the patient had hypertension, diabetes, and GERD.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Included a cardiac cath with no interventions taken.,HOME MEDICATIONS:,  Include Lantus insulin as well as oral hypoglycemics.,CURRENT MEDS:,  Include Levophed, Ativan, fentanyl drips, cefepime, Flagyl, fluconazole, and vancomycin.

Chest x-rays performed and show the tip of the EG tube at level of the carina with some right upper lobe congestion, but otherwise clear costophrenic angles.  Tip of the left subclavian vein catheter is appropriate, and there is no pneumothorax noted.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:,  This is a 43-year-old gentleman who is acutely ill, in critical condition with mesenteric ischemia secondary to visceral venous occlusion.  He is status post small bowel resection.  We plan to go back to operating room tomorrow for further debridement and possible closure.  Neurologically, the patient initially had question of encephalopathy while in the hospital secondary to slow awakening after previous intubation; however, he did clear eventually, and was able to follow commands.  I did not suspect any sort of pathologic abnormality of his neurologic status as he has further CT scan of his brain, which was normal.  Currently, we will keep him sedated and on fentanyl drip to ease pain and facilitate ventilation on the respirator.  We will form daily sedation holidays to assess his neurologic status and avoid over sedating with Ativan.,1.  Cardiovascular.  The patient currently is in septic shock requiring vasopressors maintained on MAP greater than 70.  We will continue to try to wean the vasopressin after continued volume loading, also place SvO2 catheter to assess his oxygen delivery and consumption given his state of shock.  Currently, his rhythm is of sinus tachycardia, I do not suspect AFib or any other arrhythmia at this time.  If he does not improve as expected with volume resuscitation and with resolution of his sepsis, we will obtain an echocardiogram to assess his cardiac function.  Once he is off the vasopressors, we will try low-dose beta blockade as tolerated to reduce his rate.,2.  Pulmonology.  Currently, the patient is on full vent support with a rate of 20, tidal volume of 550, pressure support of 10, PEEP of 6, and FiO2 of 60.  We will wean his FiO2 as tolerated to keep his saturation greater than 90% and wean his PEEP as tolerated to reduce preload compromise.  We will keep the head of bed elevated and start chlorhexidine as swish and swallow for VAP prevention.,3.  Gastrointestinal.  The patient has known mesenteric venous occlusion secondary to the thrombus formation at the portal vein as well as the SMV.  He is status post immediate resection of jejunum leaving a blind proximal jejunum and blind distal jejunum.  We will maintain NG tube as he has a blind stump there, and we will preclude any further administration of any meds through this NG tube.  I will keep him on GI prophylaxis as he is intubated.  We will currently hold his TPN as he is undergoing a large amount of volume changes as well as he is undergoing electrolyte changes.  He will have a long-term TPN after this acute episode.  His LFTs are all normal currently.  Once he is postop tomorrow, we will restart the Angiomax for his venous occlusion.,4.  Renal.  The patient currently is in the acute renal insufficiency with anuria and an increase in his creatinine as well as his potassium.  His critical hyperkalemia which is requiring dosing of dextrose insulin, bicarb, and calcium; we will recheck his potassium levels after this cocktail.  He currently is started to make more urine since being volume resuscitated with Hespan as well as bicarb drip.  Hopefully given his increased urine output, he will start to eliminate some potassium and will not need dialysis.  We will re-consult Nephrology at this time.,5.  Endocrine.  The patient has adrenal insufficiency based on lack of stem to cosyntropin.  We will start hydrocortisone 50 q.6h.,6.  Infectious Disease.  Currently, the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis imperially.  Given his bowel ischemia, we will continue these, and appreciate ID service's input.,7.  Hematology.

It is explained to the examinee that the traditional doctor-patient relationship does not apply to this examination, and that a written report will be provided to the agency requesting this examination. It has also been emphasized to the examinee that he should not attempt any physical activity beyond his tolerance, in order to avoid injury.,CHIEF COMPLAINTS: , Improved focal lower back pain.,HISTORY: , Abc is a 26-year-old man who immigrated to this country approximately six years ago. He speaks ""un poquito"" English and an interpreter is provided. He has worked for the last four years at Floragon Forest Products, where he normally functions as a ""stacker."" He indicates that another worker was on vacation, and because of this he was put on another job in which he separated logs using a picaroon. He was doing this on April 20, 2003, and was pulling on the picaroon when it gave way, and he fell backwards landing on a metal step, which was approximately 1 foot off of the ground. He demonstrates that he came down square on the step and did not fall backwards or hyperextend over it. He did not hit his upper back or neck or shoulders, and only sat down on the step as described. He had ""a little"" pain in his back at that time, but was able to get up and continue working. He completed his shift that day and returned to work the following day. He had the next two days off. He says that his symptoms persisted and increased, and on April 25, 2003, he went to the First Choice Physicians Chiropractic and Rehab Clinic, where he came under the care of Dr. Abcd, DC. The file contains an entrance form completed by Mr. Abc which indicates at the bottom under ""previous occurrence of the same pain"" a notation of ""Yes, but it was not really the same, it was just a little and tolerable."" There is an additional note on the side which states ""no pain prior to this injury or on that day, occasional (but low back)."" Saw this notation, he says today that he did not state this and that the form was done by ""Edna"" at Dr. Abcd's office.,Mr. Abc was initially treated three times a week and states that this has now been reduced to twice per week. He does not know how long the chiropractic treatment is to continue. Initially, he has been seen by Dr. Xyz on three occasions, the last being on August 15, 2003. Dr. Xyz has basically referred him back to Dr. Abcd for continued chiropractic management.,Mr. Abc has now returned to his normal job as a stacker and is able to do that with no significant increased pain. He does mention, however, that bending over, picking up anything particularly heavy is bothersome; however, he does not normally have to do that. He denies any new accident or injury that would be contributory either as a result of his work or outside activities or any motor vehicle accident. He does not participate physically in any sports or hobbies that would be a factor.,PRESENT COMPLAINTS: , Mr. Abc indicates at this time that he is overall better in that initially he had difficulty ""moving."" He grades his current overall level of pain as a 2 to 4 on a scale from 0 to 10, stating that the worst he had was at 6-7. He now has ""good and bad days"" which depends on his activity level noting that he is better over the weekend. He localizes his pain to the midline lumbosacral region. He states that initially he did experience some diffuse radiation into both lower extremities, but that this has now resolved. He occasionally will notice some tightness behind both knees, but again no radicular type of distribution. He denies any focal muscular weakness or sphincter disturbance. His quality of the pain at this time is a ""tightness"" which bothers him, again, primarily with bending at the waist and lifting. He is able to do his normal activities of life, including his work without any significant problem, noting again only increased pain with bending and lifting.,PAST HISTORY: , Mr. Abc denies any prior similar complaints or treatments. He denies any previous specific lower back injury. He has enjoyed essentially good lifetime health and denies any concurrent medical conditions or problems. He has seasonal allergies only with no known drug hypersensitivities. He has not been hospitalized overnight and has had no surgeries in his life. He currently takes OTC Advil and Tylenol for lower back pain, but no prescriptive medication. He does not smoke, drink, or use street drugs of any type. Review of systems and family history are generally noncontributory.,SOCIO-ECONOMIC HISTORY: , Mr. Abc, as indicated, was born and reared in Mexico and immigrated into this country six years ago.,Education: He has our equivalent of a high school education in Mexico with no additional formal education in United States.,Military History: He has no military experience in his life.,Work History: He currently is doing his normal work activities as a stacker without arbitrary restrictions or limitations. He is not receiving any Workers Compensation or other benefits at this time.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Abc presents as a cooperative and straightforward 26-year-old Hispanic male. He has a very thin body habitus with a reported height of 5 feet 7 inches and weight of 125 pounds. He is right hand dominant. He is noted to sit comfortably throughout the history taking process conversant with the interpreter and myself without observable guarding or postural conversation or motion. He did stand readily to full upright with equal weightbearing and exhibits normal spinal posture with double hips and shoulders. Lumbar lordosis is normal. He ambulates without a limp or lift, and is able to walk on heels and toes and perform a full squat and rise and hop without difficulty with some expression of increased lower back pain. Waddell's testing is negative on compression and traction with some slight increased lower back pain on passive rotation.,Kemp's maneuver of posterolateral bending has some increased localized lumbosacral pain, but no radiation distally into the buttocks or lower extremities.,Active lumbar ranges of motion with double inclinometer are:,Flexion 70 degrees.,Extension 20 degrees.,Side bending symmetric at 28 degrees.,He complains of lower back pain at the extremes of flexion only. Motion palpation reveals full mobility without any detectable intrasegmental fixation with normal symmetry and alignment.,Tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees and ankles without sensory loss to pinprick. Babinski's are neutral, and there is no clonus.,Manual muscle testing reveals 5/5 strength at the hips, knees, and ankles without give-way or complaint.,Supine passive straight leg raising is limited by hamstring tightness to 66 degrees bilaterally, but causes no expression of lower back pain or radiation. Cross leg with rotation hip joint motion is full on either side without reported hip or back pain. Hip flexion is symmetric at 130 degrees, again without complaint. Leg lengths appeared visually symmetric. Mid calf girth is 11-1/2 inches bilaterally. Five inches above the knees measured 13 inches right and left. The seated SLR is done to 90 degrees, and he brings his fingertips 2 inches from his toes, showing good flexibility at the waist despite the hamstring tightness noted in the supine straight leg raising test.,In the prone position, he has good gluteal strength on either side with Yeoman's test causing some increased lumbosacral pain but no focal sacroiliac involvement. No sacroiliac fixation is identified. Hibbs test is negative on either side.,On palpation, he reports midline tenderness at L5-S1 without additional areas of tenderness noted even to very firm palpatory pressure in the entirety of the lumbar spine over the pelvis. He indicates no focal or sacroiliac, sciatic notch, or trochanteric tenderness on either side. No definitive muscular spasm is noted in the lumbar paraspinal musculature.,Mr. Abc tolerated the examination process without apparent or expressed ill effect. ,IMAGING STUDIES:,  AP and lateral lumbar/pelvic views dated May 15, 2003 are reviewed. The films are negative for recent fracture or pathology. There appears to be a transitional lumbosacral area with a spatulated transverse process of L1 and slight narrowing of the lumbosacral disc space. No additional abnormalities are identified. The hip and sacroiliac articulations appear well preserved. Disc spacing in the rest of the lumbar spine appears normal, and no significant degenerative changes are identified. Soft tissue appeared normal without paraspinal mass or abnormality.,DIAGNOSIS: , Lumbosacral contusion/strain relative to the April 20, 2003 industrial accident - objectively resolved.,SUMMARY: , Discussion and recommendations in response to questions posed in your August 15, 2003 letter:,1. What is your diagnosis of the worker's condition as a result of the injury? Please provide objective medical findings that support your diagnosis. Please indicate if the objective findings are reproducible, measurable, or observable, and how.,The diagnosis of the workers condition secondary to the described April 20, 2003 fall is by history a lumbosacral contusion/strain. This impression is primarily made based on his history noting that at this time, he has no abnormal objective findings.,2. In your opinion, is the work injury a contributing cause of the diagnosis? If so, is the work injury the material contributing cause of the diagnosis? Please provide an explanation for your opinion.,It would appear that the work injury was the major contributing cause of the diagnosis.,3.

4725,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Left heart catheterization, left ventriculogram, aortogram, coronary angiogram.,2.  PCI of the LAD and left main coronary artery with Impella assist device.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , Unstable angina and congestive heart failure with impaired LV function.,TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE: , After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in postabsorptive and nonsedated state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 2% was used for infiltration anesthesia.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 7-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery and a 6-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral vein.  Through the arterial sheath, angiography of the right common femoral artery was obtained.  Thereafter, 6-French pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the distal aorta where angiography of the distal aorta and the bifurcation of the right and left common iliac arteries was obtained.  Thereafter, a 4-French sheath was introduced into the left common femoral artery using modified Seldinger technique.  Thereafter, the pigtail catheter was advanced over an 0.035-inch J-wire into the left ventricle and LV-gram was performed in RAO view and after pullback, an aortogram was performed in the LAO view.  Therefore, a 6-French JL4 and JR4 guiding catheters were used to engage the left and right coronary arteries respectively and multiple orthogonal views of the coronary arteries were obtained.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  ,1.  LV-gram:  LVEDP was 15 mmHg.  LV ejection fraction 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis.  Only anterior wall is contracting.  There was no mitral regurgitation.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback, and on aortography, there was no evidence of aortic dissection or aortic regurgitation.,2.  The right coronary artery is a dominant vessels with a mid 50% to 70% stenosis which was not treated.  The left main coronary artery calcified vessel with disease.,2.  The left anterior descending artery had an 80% to 90% mid-stenosis.  First diagonal branch had a more than 90% stenosis.,3.  The circumflex coronary artery had a patent stent.,INTERVENTION: , After reviewing the angiographic images, we elected to proceed with intervention of the left anterior descending artery.  The 4-French sheath in the left common femoral artery was upsized to a 12-French Impella sheath through which an Amplatz wire and a 6-French multipurpose catheter were advanced into the left ventricle.  The Amplatz wire was exchanged for an Impella 0.018-inch stiff wire.  The multipurpose catheter was removed, and the Impella was advanced into the left ventricle and a performance level of 8 was achieved with a cardiac output of 2 to 2.5 l/min.  Thereafter, a 7-French JL4 guiding catheter was used to engage the left coronary artery and an Asahi soft 0.014-inch wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery and a second 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire was advanced into the diagonal branch.  The diagonal branch was predilated with a 2.5 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon at nominal atmospheres and thereafter a 2.5 x 24 Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the mid-LAD and a 3.0 x 15-mm Endeavor stent was deployed in the proximal LAD.  The stent delivery balloon was used to post-dilate the overlapping segment.  The LAD, the diagonal was rewires with an 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire and a 3.0 x 20-mm Maverick balloon was advanced into the LAD for post-dilatation and a 2.0 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon was advanced into the diagonal for kissing inflations which were performed at nominal atmospheres.  At this point, it was noted that the left main had a retrograde dissection.  A 3.5 x 18-mm Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the left main coronary artery.  The Asahi soft wire in the diagonal was removed and placed into the circumflex coronary artery.  Kissing inflations of the LAD and the circumflex coronary artery were performed using 3.0 x 20 Maverick balloons x2 balloons, inflated at high atmospheres of 14.,RESULTS: , Lesion reduction in the LAD FROM 90% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the diagonal from 90% to less than 60% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the left maintained coronary artery from 50% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and the inflations well with no evidence of any hemodynamic instability.  The Impella device was gradually decreased from performance level of 8 to performance level of 1 at which point it was removed into the aorta and it was turned off and the Impella was removed from the body and the 2 Perclose sutures were tightened.  From the right common femoral artery, a 6-French IMA catheter was advanced and an 0.035-inch wire down into the left common femoral and superficial femoral artery, over which an 8 x 40 balloon was advanced and tamponade of the arteriotomy site of the left common femoral artery was performed from within the artery at 3 atmospheres for a total of 20 minutes.  The right common femoral artery and vein sheaths were both sutured in place for further observation.  Of note, the patient received Angiomax during the procedure and an ACT above 300 was maintained.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 10% to 15%.,2.  High complex percutaneous coronary intervention of the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, and diagonal with Impella circulatory support.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.  The estimated blood loss was 200 ml.  Estimated dye used was 200 ml of Visipaque.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable with no hypotension and no hematomas in the groins.,PLAN:  ,1.  Aspirin, Plavix, statins, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors as tolerated.,2.  Hydration.,3.  The patient will be observed over night for any hemodynamic instability or ischemia.  If she remains stable, the right common femoral artery and vein sheaths will be removed and manual pressure will be applied for hemostasis.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

441,"OPERATION PERFORMED:, Phacoemulsification of cataract and posterior chamber lens implant, right eye., ,ANESTHESIA:, Retrobulbar nerve block, right eye, ,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: ,The patient was brought to the operating room where local anesthetic was administered to the right eye followed by a dilute drop of Betadine and a Honan balloon.  Once anesthesia was achieved, the right eye was prepped with Betadine, rinsed with saline, and draped in a sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was placed and 4-0 silk sutures passed under the superior and inferior rectus muscles stabilizing the globe.  A fornix-based conjunctival flap was prepared superiorly from 10 to 12 o'clock and episcleral vessels were cauterized using a wet-field.  A surgical groove was applied with a 69 Beaver blade 1 mm posterior to the limbus in a frown configuration in the 10 to 12 o'clock position.  A lamellar dissection was carried anteriorly to clear cornea using a crescent knife.  A stab incision was applied with a Superblade at the 2 o'clock position at the limbus.  The chamber was also entered through the lamellar groove using a 3-mm keratome in a beveled fashion.  Viscoat was injected into the chamber and an anterior capsulorrhexis performed.  Hydrodissection was used to delineate the nucleus and the phacoemulsification tip was inserted into the chamber.  A deep linear groove was dissected through the nucleus vertically and the nucleus was rotated 90 degrees with the assistance of a spatula through the side-port incision.  A second groove was dissected perpendicular to the first and the nucleus was fractured into quadrants.  Each quadrant was emulsified under burst power within the capsular bag.  The epinuclear bowl was manipulated with vacuum, flipped into the iris plane, and emulsified under pulse power.  I&A was used to aspirate cortex from the capsular bag.  A scratcher was used to polish the capsule, and Viscoat was injected inflating the capsular bag and chamber.  The wound was enlarged with a shortcut blade to 5.5 mm.  The intraocular lens was examined, found to be adequate, irrigated with balanced salt, and inserted into the capsular bag.  The lens centralized nicely and Viscoat was removed using the I&A.  Balanced salt was injected through the side-port incision.  The wound was tested, found to be secure, and a single 10-0 nylon suture was applied to the wound with the knot buried within the sclera.  The conjunctiva was pulled over the suture, and Ancef 50 mg and Decadron 4 mg were injected sub-Tenon in the inferonasal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Maxitrol ointment was applied topically followed by an eye pad and shield.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was taken from the operating room in good condition.",Surgery

3157,"HYPERFRACTIONATION,This patient is to undergo a course of hyperfractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of known malignancy.  The radiotherapy will be given in a hyperfractionated fraction (decreased dose per fraction but 2 fractions delivered daily separated by a period of at least 6 hours).  The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiologic principles that make this type of therapy more effective in rapidly growing, previously irradiated or poorly oxygenated tumors.  The dose per fraction and the total dose are calculated by me, and this is individualized for each patient according to radiobiologic principles.,During the hyperfractionated radiotherapy, the chance of severe acute side effects is increased, so the patient will be followed more intensively for the development of any side effects and treatment instituted accordingly.",Hematology - Oncology

3071,"XYZ, O.D.,RE:  ABC,DOB:  MM/DD/YYYY,Dear XYZ:,Thank you very much for your kind referral of Mrs. ABC who you referred to me for narrow angles and possible associated glaucoma.  I examined Mrs. ABC initially on MM/DD/YYYY.  At that time, she expressed a chief concern of occasional pain around her eye, but denied any flashing lights, floaters, halos, or true brow ache.  She reports a family history of glaucoma in her mother, but is unsure of the specific kind.  Her past ocular history has been fairly unremarkable.  As you know, she has a history of non-insulin dependent diabetes.  She is unaware of her last hemoglobin A1c levels, but reports a blood sugar of 158 taken on the morning of her appointment with me.  She is followed by Dr. X here locally.,Upon examination, her visual acuity measured 20/20-1 in either eye with her glasses.  Presenting intraocular pressures were14 mmHg in either eye at 2:03 p.m.  Pupillary reactions, confrontational visual fields, and ocular motility were normal.  The slit lamp exam revealed narrow anterior chambers and on gonioscopy only the buried anterior trabecular meshwork was visible in either eye, but the angle deepened with gonio-compression suggesting appositional and not synechial closure.  I deferred the dilated portion of the exam on that day.,We proceeded with peripheral iridectomies and following this upon her most recent visit on MM/DD/YYYY, I was able to safely dilate her eyes as her chambers had deepened and the PIs were patent.  I note that she has an increased CD ratio measuring 0.65 in the right eye and 0.7 in the left and although her FDT visual fields and GDX testing were normal at your office, she does have an enlarged blind spot in either eye on Humphrey visual fields and retinal tomography also shows some suspicious changes.  Therefore, I feel she has sustained some optic nerve damage perhaps from intermittent angle closure in the past.,In summary, Mrs. ABC has a history of narrow angles not successfully treated with laser PIs.

She had severe dyspareunia and chronic suprapelvic pain.  The patient had had a prior left salpingoophorectomy laparoscopically in 2004 for same disease process.  Now, she presented with a recurrent right ovarian endometrioma and severe pelvic pain.  She desired surgical treatment.  She accepted risk of a complete hysterectomy and salpingoophorectomy, risk of injury to underlying organs.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives were clearly discussed with the patient as documented in the medical record.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , Absent left adnexa.  Right ovary about 6 cm with chocolate cyst and severely adherent to the right pelvic side wall, uterus, and colon.  Careful dissection to free right ovary and remove it although it is likely that some ovarian tissue remains behind.  Ureter visualized and palpated on right and appears normal.  Indigo carmine given IV with no leaks intraperitoneally noted.  Sigmoid colon dissected free from back of uterus and from cul-de-sac.  Bowel free of lacerations or denudation.  Upon inspection, right tube with hydrosalpinx, appendix absent.  Omental adhesions to ensure abdominal wall was lysed.,TECHNICAL PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent smooth induction of general anesthesia.  She was placed in a supine position with a transurethral Foley in place and compression stockings in place.  The abdomen and vagina were thoroughly prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the scalpel and carried down sharply to the underlying layer of fascia and peritoneum.  The peritoneum was bluntly entered and the incision extended caudally and cephaladly with good visualization of underlying organs.  Next, exploration of the abdominal and pelvic organs revealed the above noted findings.  The uterus was enlarged and probably contained adenomyosis.  There were dense adhesions, and a large right endometrioma with a chocolate cyst-like material contained within.  The sigmoid colon was densely adhered to the cul-de-sac into the posterior aspect of the uterus.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed into the incision, and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  Next, a sharp and blunt dissection was used to free the extensive adhesions, and enterolysis was performed with very careful attention not to injure or denude the bowel.  Next, the left round ligament and cornual region was divided, transected, and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The anterior and posterior leafs of the broad ligament were dissected and opened anteriorly to the level of the bladder.  The uterine arteries were skeletonized on the left, and these were suture-clamped and transected with 0 Polysorb with good hemostasis noted.  Next, the bladder flap was developed anteriorly, and the bladder peritoneum was sharply and bluntly dissected off of the lower uterus.,On the right, a similar procedure was performed.  The right round ligament was suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  It was transected and divided with electrocautery.  The anterior and posterior leafs of the broad ligament were dissected and developed anteriorly and posteriorly, and this area was relatively avascular.  The left infundibulopelvic ligament was identified.  It was cross-clamped and transected, suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb with good hemostasis noted.  Next, the uterine arteries were skeletonized on the right.  They were transected and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The uterosacral ligaments were taken bilaterally and transected and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The cardinal ligaments were taken near their insertion into the cervical and uterine tissue.  Pedicles were sharply developed and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  Next, the electrocautery was used to dissect the cervix anteriorly from the underlying vagina.  Once entry into the vagina was made, the cervix and uterus were amputated with Jorgensen scissors.  The vaginal cuff angles were suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb and transfixed to the ipsilateral, cardinal, and uterosacral ligaments for vaginal support.  The remainder of the vagina was closed with figure-of-eight sutures in an interrupted fashion with good hemostasis noted.,Next, the right ovarian tissue was densely adherent to the colon.  It was sharply and bluntly dissected, and most of the right ovary and endometrioma was removed and dissected off completely; however, there is a quite possibility that small remnants of ovarian tissue were left behind.  The right ureter was seen and palpated.  It did not appear to be dilated and had good peristalsis noted.  Next, the retractors were removed.  The laparotomy sponges were removed from the abdomen.  The rectus fascia was closed with 0 Polysorb in a continuous running fashion with 2 sutures meeting in the midline.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with 0 plain gut in an interrupted fashion.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Polysorb in a subcuticular fashion.  A thin layer of Dermabond was placed.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x 2.

A scalpel was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision, which was carried down sharply through the subcutaneous tissue to the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the midline and incision was carried laterally bilaterally with curved Mayo scissors.  The fascia was then bluntly and sharply dissected free from the underlying rectus abdominis muscles.  The rectus abdominis muscles were then bluntly dissected in the midline and this incision was carried forward inferiorly and superiorly with care taken to avoid bladder and bowel.  The peritoneum was then bluntly entered and this incision was carried forward inferiorly and superiorly with care taken to avoid bladder and bowel.  The O'Connor-O'Sullivan instrument was then placed without difficulty.  The uterus was grasped with a thyroid clamp and the entire pelvis was then visualized without difficulty.  The GIA stapling instrument was then used to separate the infundibulopelvic ligament in a ligated fashion from the body of the uterus.  This was performed on the left infundibulopelvic ligament and the right infundibulopelvic ligament without difficulty.  Hemostasis was noted at this point of the procedure.  The bladder flap was then developed free from the uterus without difficulty.  Careful dissection of the uterus from the pedicle with the uterine arteries and cardinal ligaments was then performed using #1 chromic suture ligature in an interrupted fashion on the left and right side.  This was done without difficulty.  The uterine fundus was then separated from the uterine cervix without difficulty.  This specimen was sent to pathology for identification.  The cervix was then developed with careful dissection.  Jorgenson scissors were then used to remove the cervix from the vaginal cuff.  This was sent to pathology for identification.  Hemostasis was noted at this point of the procedure.  A #1 chromic suture ligature was then used in running fashion at the angles and along the cuff.  Hemostasis was again noted.  Figure-of-eight sutures were then used in an interrupted fashion to close the cuff.  Hemostasis was again noted.  The entire pelvis was washed.  Hemostasis was noted.  The peritoneum was then closed using 2-0 chromic suture ligature in running pursestring fashion.  The rectus abdominis muscles were approximated using #1 chromic suture ligature in an interrupted fashion.  The fascia was closed using 0 Vicryl in interlocking running fashion.  Foundation sutures were then placed in an interrupted fashion for further closing the fascia.  The skin was closed with staple gun.

Laparoscopically, the patient has large omental to anterior abdominal wall adhesions along the left side of the abdomen extending down to the left adnexa.  There are adhesions involving the right ovary to the anterior abdominal wall and the bowel.  There are also adhesions from the omentum to the anterior abdominal wall near the liver.  The uterus and ovaries appear within normal limits other than the adhesions.  The left fallopian tube grossly appeared within normal limits.  The right fallopian tube was not well visualized but appeared grossly scarred and no tubal end was visualized.  There was a large area of endometriosis, approximately 1 cm wide in the left ovarian fossa and there was a small spot of endometriosis in the posterior cul-de-sac.  There was also vesicular appearing endometriosis lesion in the posterior cul-de-sac.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken in the operating room and generalized anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  After exam under anesthetic, weighted speculum was placed in the vagina.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was sounded and then was serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size 10 Hank, then the uterine manipulator was inserted and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix.  At this point, the vulsellum tenaculum was removed along with the weighted speculum and attention was turned towards the abdomen.  An approximately 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to the umbilicus with the skin knife.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp.  The abdomen was tented up and a Veress needle inserted through this incision.  When the Veress needle was felt to be in place, deep position was checked by placing saline in the needle.  This was seen to freely drop in the abdomen so it was connected to CO2 gas.  Again, this was started at the lowest setting, was seen to flow freely, so it was advanced to the high setting.  The abdomen was then insufflated to an adequate distention.  Once an adequate distention was reached, the CO2 gas was disconnected.  The Veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was placed.  Next, the laparoscope was inserted through this port.  The medial port was connected to CO2 gas.  Next, a 1 cm incision was made in the midline approximately 2 fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis.  Through this, a Veress needle was inserted followed by size #5 step trocar and this procedure was repeated under direct visualization on the right upper quadrant lateral to the umbilicus and a size #5 trocar was also placed.  Next, a grasper was placed through the suprapubic port.  This was used to grasp the bowel that was adhesed to the right ovary and the Harmonic scalpel was then used to lyse these adhesions.  Bowel was carefully examined afterwards and no injuries or bleeding were seen.  Next, the adhesions touching the right ovary and anterior abdominal wall were lysed with the Harmonic scalpel and this was done without difficulty.  There was a small amount of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall peritoneum.  This was ablated with the Harmonic scalpel.  The Harmonic scalpel was used to lyse and ablate the endometriosis in the left ovarian fossa and the posterior cul-de-sac.  Both of these areas were seen to be hemostatic.  Next, a grasper was placed and was used to bluntly remove the vesicular lesion from the posterior cul-de-sac.  This was sent to pathology.  Next, the pelvis was copiously irrigated with the Nezhat dorsi suction irrigator and the irrigator was removed.  It was seen to be completely hemostatic.  Next, the two size #5 ports were removed under direct visualization.  The camera was removed.  The abdomen was desufflated.  The size #11 introducer was replaced and the #11 port was removed.,Next, all the ports were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  The incisions were dressed with Steri-Strips and bandaged appropriately and the patient was taken to recovery in stable condition and she will be discharged home today with Darvocet for pain and she will follow-up in one week in the clinic for pathology results and to have a postoperative check.",Obstetrics / Gynecology

Flexor tenotomy, bilateral third toes.,HISTORY:,  This is a 36-year-old female who presented to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o. since mid night for surgery on her painful bunion to her right foot and her painful hammertoes to both feet.  The patient has a history of sharp pain, which is aggravated by wearing shoes and ambulation.  She has tried multiple conservative methods and treatment such as wide shoes and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed in detail by Dr. Kaczander with the patient and the consent is available on the chart.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety strap placed across her waist for her protection.,Copious amounts of Webril were applied about both ankles and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  After adequate IV sedation was administered, a total of 18 cc of a 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to anesthetize the right foot, performing a Mayo block and a bilateral third, fourth, and fifth digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion bilaterally.  The foot was elevated off the table and an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated on the right foot to 200 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected proximally.  Attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint, it was found to be contracted and there was lateral deviation of the hallux.  There was decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  A dorsolinear incision was made with a #10 blade, approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a #15 blade.  Any small veins traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined sharply.  Care was taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Next, the first metatarsal joint capsule was identified.  A #15 blade was used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  The PASA was found to be within normal limits.  There was a hypertrophic medial eminence noted.  A sagittal saw was used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head as an access guide.  A standard lateral release was performed.  The fibular sesamoid was found to be in the interspace, but was relocated onto the metatarsal head properly.  Next, a sagittal saw was used to perform a long arm Austin osteotomy.  The K-wire was removed.  The capital fragment was shifted laterally and impacted into the head.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the osteotomy.  A 2.7 x 16 mm Synthes, fully threaded cortical screw was throne using standard AO technique.  A second screw was throne, which was a 2.0 x 12 mm Synthes cortical screw.  Excellent fixation was achieved and the screws tightly perched the bone.  Next, the medial overhanging wedge was removed with a sagittal saw.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was removed.  The screws were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsular periosteal tissues with simple interrupted suture technique.  A #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique.  A #5-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third digit, which was found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to make two convergent semi-elliptical incisions over the distal interphalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  The wedge of skin was removed in full thickness.  The long extensor tendon was identified and the distal and proximal borders of the wound were undermined.  The #15 blade was used to transect the long extensor tendon, which was reflected proximally.  The distal interphalangeal joint was identified and the #15 blade was placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released.  Crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx.  Next, a double action bone cutter was used to resect the head of the middle phalanx.  The toe was dorsiflexed and was found to have an excellent rectus position.  A hand rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The flexor tendon was found to be contracted, therefore, a flexor tenotomy was performed through the dorsal incision.  Next, #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result was achieved.,Attention was directed to the fourth toe, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated.  An oblique skin incision with two converging semi-elliptical incisions was created using #15 blade.  The rest of the procedure was repeated exactly the same as the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot.  All the same suture materials were used.  However, there was no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe, only on the third toe bilaterally.,Attention was directed to the fifth right digit, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  A linear incision approximately 2 cm in length was made with a #15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  The medial and lateral margins were undermined sharply to the level of the long extensor tendon.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was identified and the tendon was transected with the #15 blade.  The tendon was reflected proximally, off the head of the proximal phalanx.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A double action bone nibbler was used to remove the head of the proximal phalanx.  A hand rasp was used to smooth residual bone.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.,A standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,Attention was directed to the left foot.  The foot was elevated off the table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was directed to the left fifth toe, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  The exact same procedure, performed to the right fifth digit, was performed on this toe, with the same materials being used for suture and closure.,Attention was then directed to the left fourth digit, which was found to contracted and slightly abducted and varus rotated.  The exact same procedure as performed to the right fourth toe was performed, consisting of two semi-elliptical skin incisions in an oblique angle.  The same suture material were used to close the incision.,Attention was directed to the left third digit, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  The same procedure performed on the right third digit was also performed.  The same suture materials were used to close the wound and the flexor tenotomy was also performed at this digit.  A standard postoperative dressing was also applied to the left foot consisting of the same materials as described for the right foot.  The pneumatic tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the foot.  She was given postoperative shoes and will be partial weighbearing with crutches.  She was admitted short-stay to Dr. Kaczander for pain control.  She was placed on Demerol 50 and Vistaril 25 mg IM q3-4h. p.r.n. for pain.  She will have Vicodin 5/500 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. for moderate pain.  She was placed on Subq. heparin and given incentive spirometry 10 times an hour.  She will be discharged tomorrow.  She is to ice and elevate both feet today and rest as much as possible.,Physical Therapy will teach her crutch training today.  X-rays were taken in the postoperative area and revealed excellent position of the screws and correction of bunion deformity as well as the hammertoe deformities.",Podiatry

Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.  The patient was awake and taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable at the completion of the procedure.  All sponge and lap, needle and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.",Surgery

He had an inguinal hernia on physical exam in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic and is here now for elective repair.  We met with his parents and explained the surgical technique, risks, and talked to them about trying to perform a diagnostic laparoscopic look at the contralateral side to rule out an occult hernia.  All their questions have been answered and they agreed with the plan.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient had a well developed, but rather thin walled hernia sac on the right.  The thinness of hernia sac made it difficult to safely cannulate through the sac for the laparoscopy.  Therefore, high ligation was performed, and we aborted the plan for laparoscopic view of the left side.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient came to operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  Surgical time-out was conducted while we were preparing and draping his abdomen with chlorhexidine based prep solution.  During our time-out, we reiterated the patient's name, medical record number, weight, allergies status, and planned operative procedure.  I then infiltrated 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine in the soft tissues around the inguinal crease in the right lower abdomen chosen for hernia incision.  An additional aliquot of Marcaine was injected deep to the external oblique fascia performing the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block.  A curvilinear incision was made with a scalpel and a combination of electrocautery and some blunt dissection and scissor dissection was used to clear the tissue layers through Scarpa fascia and expose the external oblique.  After the oblique layers were opened, the cord structure were identified and elevated.  The hernia sac was carefully separated from the spermatic cord structures and control of the sac was obtained.  Dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of deep inguinal ring was performed.  I attempted to gently pass a 3-mm trocar through the hernia sac, but it was rather difficult and I became fearful that the sac would be torn in proximal control and mass ligation would be less effective.  I aborted the laparoscopic approach and performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  The excess sac was trimmed and the spermatic cord structures were replaced.  The external oblique fascia and Scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  Blood loss was less than 5 mL.  The hernia sac was submitted for specimen, and he was then taken to the recovery room in good condition.",Urology
1471,"HISTORY:, This is a digital EEG performed on a 75-year-old male with seizures.,BACKGROUND ACTIVITY:, The background activity consists of a 8 Hz to 9 Hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. This rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. There are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 Hz to 5 Hz which suggests possible Parkinson's. Part of the EEG is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. There are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. At one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region.,ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:, Photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality.,SLEEP PATTERNS:, No sleep architecture was observed during this tracing.,IMPRESSION:, This awake/alert/drowsy EEG is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. The slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc., should be ruled out. The tremor probably represents a Parkinson's tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended.",Sleep Medicine

Congenital heart disease.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Gastrostomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS:  ,This 6-week-old female infant had been transferred to Children's Hospital because of Down syndrome and congenital heart disease.  She has not been able to feed well and in fact has to now be NG tube fed.  Her swallowing mechanism does not appear to be very functional, and therefore, it was felt that in order to aid in her home care that she would be better served with a gastrostomy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in usual manner.  Transverse left upper quadrant incision was made and carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection.  The muscle was divided and the peritoneal cavity entered.  The greater curvature of the stomach was grasped with a Babcock clamp and brought into the operative field.  The site for gastrostomy was selected and a pursestring suture of #4-0 Nurolon placed in the gastric wall.  A 14-French 0.8 cm Mic-Key tubeless gastrostomy button was then placed into the stomach and the pursestring secured about the tube.  Following this, the stomach was returned to the abdominal cavity and the posterior fascia was closed using a #4-0 Nurolon affixing the stomach to the posterior fascia.  The anterior fascia was then closed with #3-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue with the same, and the skin closed with #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl.  The balloon was inflated to the full 5 mL.

Posterior elements to include laminotomy-foraminotomy and decompression of the nerve roots.,IMPLANT: , Sofamor Danek (Medtronic) Legacy 5.5 Titanium system.,MONITORING: , SSEPs, and the EPs were available.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 12-year-old female, who has had a very dysmorphic scoliosis.  She had undergone a workup with an MRI, which showed no evidence of cord abnormalities.  Therefore, the risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with Surgery with the mother, to include infections, bleeding, nerve injuries, vascular injuries, spinal cord injury with catastrophic loss of motor function and bowel and bladder control.  I also discussed ___________ and need for revision surgery.  The mom understood all this and wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent general anesthetic.  She then had lines placed, and was then placed in a prone position.  Monitoring was then set up, and it was then noted that we could not obtain motor-evoked potentials.  The SSEPs were clear and were compatible with the preoperative, but no preoperative motors had been done, and there was a concern that possibly this could be from the result of the positioning.  It was then determined at that time, that we would go ahead and proceed to wake her up, and make sure she could move her feet.  She was then lightened under anesthesia, and she could indeed dorsiflex and plantarflex her feet, so therefore, it was determined to go ahead and proceed with only monitoring with the SSEPs.,The patient after being prepped and draped sterilely, a midline incision was made, and dissection was carried down.  The dissection utilized a combination of hand instruments and electrocautery and dissected out along the laminae and up to the transverse processes.  This occurred from T2-L2.  Fluoroscopy was brought in to verify positions and levels.  Once this was done, and all bleeding was controlled, retractors were then placed.  Attention was then turned towards placing screws first on the left side.  Lumbar screws were placed at the junction of the transverse process and the facets under fluoroscopic guidance.  The area was opened with a high speed burr, and then the track was defined with a blunt probe, and a ball-tipped feeler was then utilized to verify all walls were intact.  They were then tapped, and then screws were then placed.  This technique was used at L1 and L2, both the right and left.  At T12, a direct straight-ahead technique was utilized, where the facet was removed, and then the position was chosen under the fluoroscopy, and then it was spurred, the track was defined and then probed and tapped, and it was felt to be in good position.  Two screws, in the right and left were placed at T12 as well, reduction screws on the left.  The same technique was used for T11, where right and left screws were placed as well as T10 on the left.  At T9, a screw was placed on the left, and this was a reduction screw.  On the left at T8, a screw could not be placed due to the dysmorphic nature of the pedicle.  It was not felt to be intact; therefore, a screw was left out of this.  On the right, a thoracic screw was placed as well as at 7 and 6.  This was the dysmorphic portion of this.  Screws were attempted to be placed up, they could not be placed, so attention was then turned towards placing pedicle hooks.  Pedicle hooks were done by first making a box out of the pedicle, removing the complete pedicle, feeling the undersurface of the pedicle with a probe, and then seating the hook.  Upgoing pedicle hooks were placed at T3, T4, and T5.  A downgoing laminar hook was placed at the T7 level.  Screws had been placed at T6 and T7 on the right.  An upgoing pedicle hook was also placed at T3 on the right, and then, downgoing laminar hooks were placed at T2.  This was done by first using a transverse process, lamina finders to go around the transverse process and then ___________ laminar hooks.  Once all hooks were in place, spinal osteotomies were performed at T7-T8 and T8-T9.  This was the level of the kyphosis, to bring her back out of her kyphoscoliosis.  First the ligamentum flavum was resected using a large Kerrisons.  Next, the laminotomy was performed, and then a Kerrison was used to remove the ligamentum flavum at the level of the facet.  Once this was accomplished, a laminotomy was performed by removing more of the lamina, and to create a small wedge that could be closed down later to correct the kyphosis.  This was then brought out with resection of bone out to the foramen, doing a foraminotomy to free up the foramen on both sides.  This was done also between the T8-T9.  Once this was completed, Gelfoam was then placed.  Next, we observed, and measured and contoured.  The rods were then seated on the left, and then a derotation maneuver was performed.  Hooks had come loose, so the rod was removed on the left.  The hooks were then replaced, and the rod was reseated.  Again, it was derotated to give excellent correction.  Hooks were then well seated underneath, and therefore, they were then locked.  A second rod was then chosen on the right, and was measured, contoured, and then seated.  Next, once this was done, the rods were locked in the midsubstance, and then the downgoing pedicle hook, which had been placed at T7 was then helped to compress T8 as was the pedicle screw, and then this compressed the osteotomy sites quite nicely.  Next, distraction was then utilized to further correct at the spine, and to correct on the left, the left concave curve, which gave excellent correction.  On the right, compression was used to bring it down, and then, in the lower lumbar areas, distraction and compression were used to level out L2.  Once this was done, all screws were tightened.  Fluoroscopy was then brought in to verify L1 was level, and the first ribs were also level, and it gave a nice balanced spine.  Everything was copiously irrigated, ___________.  Next, a wake-up test was performed, and the patient was then noted to flex and extend the knees as well as dorsiflex and plantar flex both the feet.  The patient was then again sedated and brought back under general anesthesia.  Next, a high-speed burr was used for decortication.  After final tightening had been accomplished, and then allograft bone and autograft bone were mixed together with 10 mL of iliac crest aspirate and were placed into the wound.  The open canal areas had been protected with Gelfoam.  Once this was accomplished, the deep fascia was closed with multiple figure-of-eight #1's, oversewn with a running #1, _________ were then placed in the subcutaneous spaces which were then closed with 3-0 Vicryl, and then the skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Drains had been placed in the subcutaneous layer x2.  The patient during the case had no changes in the SSEPs, had a normal wake-up test, and had received Ancef and clindamycin during the case.  She was taken from the operating room in good condition.",Surgery

The large and small bowels were completely enveloping a large right ovarian cystic mass.  Normal anatomy was difficult to see due to adhesions.  Cyst was ruptured incidentally intraoperatively with approximately 150 mL to 200 mL of turbid fluid.  Cyst wall, tube, and ovary were stripped away from the bowel.  Posterior peritoneum was also removed in order to completely remove the cyst wall ovary and tube.  There was excellent postoperative hemostasis.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where general anesthesia was achieved without difficulty.  She was then placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A vertical midline incision was made from the umbilicus and extended to the symphysis pubis along the line of the patient's prior incision.  Incision was carried down carefully until the peritoneal cavity was reached.  Care was taken upon entry of the peritoneum to avoid injury of underlying structures.  At this point, the extensive adhesive disease was noted, again requiring greater than 45 minutes of dissection in order to visualize the intended anatomy for surgery.  The omentum was carefully stripped away from the patient's right side developing a window.  This was extended down along the inferior portion of the incision removing the omentum from its adhesions to the anterior peritoneum and what appears to be the vesicouterine peritoneum.  A large mass of bowel was noted to be adherent to itself causing a quite tortuous course.  Adhesiolysis was performed in order to free up the bowel in order to pack it out of the pelvis.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.  The bowel was then packed over of the pelvis allowing visualization of a matted mass of large and small bowel surrounding a large ovarian cyst.  Careful adhesive lysis and dissection enabled the colon to be separated from the posterior wall of the cyst.  Small bowel and portion of the colon were adherent anteriorly on the cyst and during the dissection of these to remove them from their attachment, the cyst was ruptured.  Large amount of turbid fluid was noted and was evacuated.  The cyst wall was then carefully placed under tension and stripped away from the patient's small and large bowel.  Once the bowel was freed, the remnants of round ligament was identified, elevated, and the peritoneum was incised opening the retroperitoneal space.,The retroperitoneal space was opened following the line of the ovarian vessels, which were identified and elevated and a window made inferior to the ovarian vessels, but superior to the course of the ureter.  This pedicle was doubly clamped, transected, and tied with a free tie of #2-0 Vicryl.  A suture ligature of #0 Vicryl was used to obtain hemostasis.  Excellent hemostasis was noted at this pedicle.  The posterior peritoneum and portion of the remaining broad ligament were carefully dissected and shelled out to remove the tube and ovary, which was still densely adherent to the peritoneum.  Care was taken at the side of the remnant of the uterine vessels.  However, a laceration of the uterine vessels did occur, which was clamped with a right-angle clamp, and carefully sutured ligated with excellent hemostasis noted.  Remainder of the specimen was then shelled out including portions of the posterior and sidewall peritoneum and removed.,The opposite tube and ovary were identified, were also matted behind a large amount of large bowel and completely enveloped and wrapped in the fallopian tube.  Minimal dissection was performed in order to ascertain and ensure that the ovary appeared completely normal.  It was then left in situ.  Hemostasis was achieved in the pelvis with the use of electrocautery.  The abdomen and pelvis were copiously irrigated with warm saline solution.  The peritoneal edges were inspected and found to have good hemostasis after the side of the uterine artery pedicle, and the ovarian vessel pedicle.  The areas of the bowel had previously been dissected and due to adhesive disease, it was carefully inspected and excellent hemostasis was noted.,All instruments and packs removed from the patient's abdomen.  The abdomen was closed with a running mattress closure of #0 PDS, beginning at the superior aspect of the incision, and extending inferiorly.  Excellent closure of the incision was noted.  The subcutaneous tissues were then copiously irrigated.  Hemostasis was achieved with the use of cautery.  Subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated to close the edge space with a several interrupted sutures of #0 plain gut suture.  The skin was closed with staples.,Incision was sterilely clean and dressed.  The patient was awakened from general anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  All counts were noted correct times three.",Surgery

In addition to this, he had a large herniated disk at C3-C4 in the midline.,PROCEDURE: , Anterior cervical discectomy fusion C3-C4 and C4-C5 using operating microscope and the ABC titanium plates fixation with bone black bone procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient placed in the supine position, the neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Incision was made in the midline the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid at the level of C4.  Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and vertebral muscles divided longitudinally in the direction of the fibers and the trachea and esophagus was retracted medially.  The carotid sheath was retracted laterally after dissecting the longus colli muscle away from the vertebral osteophytes we could see very large osteophytes at C4-C5.  It appeared that the C5-C6 disk area had fused spontaneously.  We then confirmed that position by taking intraoperative x-rays and then proceeded to do discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5.,After placing distraction screws and self-retaining retractors with the teeth beneath the bellies of the longus colli muscles, we then meticulously removed the disk at C3-C4, C4-C5 using the combination of angled strip, pituitary rongeurs, and curettes after we had incised the anulus fibrosus with #15 blade.,Next step was to totally decompress the spinal cord using the operating microscope and high-speed cutting followed by the diamond drill with constant irrigation.  We then drilled off the uncovertebral osteophytes and midline osteophytes as well as thinning out the posterior longitudinal ligaments.  This was then removed with 2-mm Kerrison rongeur.  After we removed the posterior longitudinal ligament, we could see the dura pulsating nicely.  We did foraminotomies at C3-C4 as well as C4-C5 as well.  After having totally decompressed both the cord as well as the nerve roots of C3-C4, C4-C5, we proceeded to the next step, which was a fusion.,We sized two 8-mm cortical cancellous grafts and after distracting the bone at C3-C4, C4-C5, we gently tapped the grafts into place.  The distraction was removed and the grafts were now within.  We went to the next step for the procedure, which was the instrumentation and stabilization of the fused area.,We then placed a titanium ABC plate from C3-C5, secured it with 16-mm titanium screws.  X-rays showed good position of the screws end plate.,The next step was to place Jackson-Pratt drain to the vertebral fascia.  Meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissue.  Steri-Strips were used for skin closure.  Blood loss less than about 200 mL.  No complications of the surgery.

1674,"FINDINGS:,There is a well demarcated mass lesion of the deep lobe of the left parotid gland measuring approximately 2.4 X 3.9 X 3.0cm (AP X transverse X craniocaudal) in size. The lesion is well demarcated. There is a solid peripheral rim with a mean attenuation coefficient of 56.3. There is a central cystic appearing area with a mean attenuation coefficient of 28.1 HU, suggesting an area of central necrosis. There is the suggestion of mild peripheral rim enhancement. This large lesion within the deep lobe of the parotid gland abuts and effaces the facial nerve. Primary consideration is of a benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma), however, other solid mass lesions cannot be excluded, for which histologic evaluation would be necessary for definitive diagnosis. The right parotid gland is normal.,There is mild enlargement of the left jugulodigastric node, measuring 1.1cm in size, with normal morphology (image #33/68).

He has had a 2-day history of fever that has gone up to as high as 103.6 degrees F. He has also had intermittent cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea and no history of rashes.  He has been taking Tylenol and Advil to help decrease the fevers, but the fever has continued to rise.  He was noted to have some increased workup of breathing and parents returned to the office on the day of admission.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for being born at 33 weeks' gestation with a birth weight of 5 pounds and 1 ounce.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On exam, he was moderately ill appearing and lethargic.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Tympanic membranes were red and yellow, and opaque bilaterally.  Nares were patent.  Oropharynx was slightly moist and pink.  Neck was soft and supple without masses.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  Lungs showed increased workup of breathing, moderate tachypnea.  No rales, rhonchi or wheezes were noted.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Active bowel sounds.  Neurologic exam showed good muscle strength, normal tone.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.,LABORATORY FINDINGS: , He had electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and glucose all of which were within normal limits.  White blood cell count was 8.6 with 61% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes, 17% monocytes, suggestive of a viral infection.  Urinalysis was completely unremarkable.  Chest x-ray showed a suboptimal inspiration, but no evidence of an acute process in the chest.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient was admitted to the hospital and allowed a clear liquid diet.  Activity is as tolerates.  CBC with differential, blood culture, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, glucose, UA, and urine culture all were ordered.  Chest x-ray was ordered as well with 2 views to evaluate for a possible pneumonia.  Pulse oximetry checks were ordered every shift and as needed with O2 ordered per nasal cannula if O2 saturations were less that 94%.  Gave D5 and quarter of normal saline at 45 mL per hour, which was just slightly above maintenance rate to help with hydration.  He was given ceftriaxone 500 mg IV once daily to treat otitis media and possible sepsis, and I will add Tylenol and ibuprofen as needed for fevers.  Overnight, he did have his oxygen saturations drop and went into oxygen overnight.  His lungs remained clear, but because of the need for O2, we instituted albuterol aerosols every 6 hours to help maintain good lung function.  The nurses were instructed to attempt to wean O2 if possible and advance the diet.  He was doing clear liquids well and so I saline locked to help to accommodate improve the mobility with the patient.  He did well the following evening with no further oxygen requirement.  He continued to spike fevers but last fever was around 13:45 on the previous day.

The patient was brought to the operating room and placud in the supine position, where (s)he wad prepped and draped in the routine fashion. A wire lid speculum was carefully placed to provide exposure. A two-armed 7 mm scleral laceration was seen in the supranasal quadrant. The laceration involved the sclera and the limbus in this area. There was a small amount of iris tissue prolapsed in the wound. The Westcott scissors and 0.12 forceps were used to carefully dissect the conjunctiva away from the wound to provide exposure. A cyclodialysis spatula was used to carefully reposit the prolapsed iris tissue back into the anterior chamber. The anterior chamber remained formed and the iris tissue easily resumed its normal position. The pupil appeared round. An 8-0 nylon suture was used to close the scleral portion of the laceration. Three sutures were placed using the 8-0 nylon suture. Then 9-0 nylon suture was used to close the limbal portion of the wound. After the wound appeared closed, a Superblade was used to create a paracentesis at approximately 2 o'clock. BSS was injected through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber. The wound was checked and found to be watertight. No leaks were observed. An 8-0 Vicryl suture was used to reposition the conjunctiva and close the wound. Three 8-0 Vicryl sutures were placed in the conjunctiva. All scleral sutures were completely covered. The anterior chamber remained formed and the pupil remained round and appeared so at the end of the case. Subconjunctival injections of Ancef and dexamethasone were given at the end of the case as well as Tobradex ointment. The lid speculum was carefully removed. The drapes were carefully removed.

The patient was seen in the emergency room.  The patient had a complete fracture of both bones with shortening bayonet apposition.  Treatment options were offered to the family including casting versus closed reduction and pinning.  The parents opted for the latter.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery included risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, and need for later hardware removal, cast tightness.  All questions were answered, and the parents agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A small incision was made at the tip of the olecranon.  Initially, a 1.11 guidewire was placed, but this was noted to be too wide for this canal.  This was changed for a 0.79 K-wire.  This was driven up to the fracture site.  The fracture was manually reduced and then the K-wire passed through the distal segment.  This demonstrated adequate fixation and reduction of both bones.  The pin was then cut short.  The fracture site and pin site was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine.  The incision was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The wounds were cleaned and dried.  Dressed with Xeroform, 4 x 4.  The patient was then placed in a well-moulded long-arm cast.  He tolerated the procedure well.

Next the neck, chest and legs were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the left of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw.  The chest retractor was positioned.  Next, full-dose heparin was given.  The pericardium was opened.  Pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  After obtaining adequate ACT, we prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 double pursestring of Ethibond suture was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed an aortic cannula connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our venous cannula connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  A 4-0 U-stitch was placed in the right atrium.  A retrograde cardioplegia catheter was positioned at this site.  Next, scissors were used to dissect out the right upper pulmonary vein.  A 4-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein.  Next, a right-angle sump was placed at this position.  We then connected our retrograde cardioplegia catheter to the cardioplegia solution circuit.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the interface between the aorta and pulmonary artery.  The aorta was completely encircled.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  We then prepared to cross-clamp the aorta.  We went down on our flows and cross-clamped the aorta.  We backed up our flows.  We then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so as to arrest the heart.  The patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected, after initially arresting the heart, to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit.  Next, after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart, we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve, and 4-0 Tycron sutures were placed in the commissures.  In addition, a 2-0 Prolene suture was placed in the aortic wall so as to bring the aortic wall and root up into view.  Next, scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflets.  Care was taken to remove all the calcium from the aortic annulus.  We then sized up the aortic annulus which came out to be a **-mm stentless porcine Toronto valve.  We prepared the valve.  Next, we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures for the annulus.  We started with our individual commissural stitches.  They were connected to our valve sewing ring.  Next, we placed 5 interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures in a subannular fashion at each commissural position.  After doing so, we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the Toronto stentless porcine valve.  The valve was lowered into place and all of the sutures were tied.  Next, we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  Next, we sewed our distal suture line.  We began with the left coronary cusp of the valve.  We ran a 5-0 RB needle up both sides of the valve.  Care was taken to avoid the left coronary ostia.  This procedure was repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve.  Again, care was taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia.  Lastly, we sewed our non-coronary cusp.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point we inspected our aortic valve.  There was good coaptation of the leaflets, and it was noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open.  We gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  The antegrade portion was given in a direct ostial fashion once again.  We now turned our attention to closing the aorta.  A 4-0 Prolene double row of suture was used to close the aorta in a running fashion.  Just prior to closing, we de-aired the heart and gave a warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  At this point, we removed our aortic cross-clamp.  The heart gradually regained its electromechanical activity.  We placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wires.  We removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  We oversewed that site with a 5-0 Prolene.  By now, the heart was de-aired and resumed normal electromechanical activity.  We began to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass.  We then removed our venous cannula and suture ligated that site with a #2 silk.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  After knowing that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed the aortic cannula.  We buttressed that site with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We placed a mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin.  We also placed 2 Blake drains, 1 in the left chest and 1 in the right chest, as the patient had some bilateral pleural effusions.  They were brought out through the skin.  The sternum was closed with #7 wires in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl.  We closed the subcu tissue with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 PDS.",Surgery

First, a shoulder roll was placed, 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the old scar, natural skin fold, and Betadine prep.  Sterile dressing was placed.  The laryngeal monitoring was noted to be working fine.  Then, an incision was made in this area in a curvilinear fashion through the old scar, taken through the fat and the platysma level.  The strap muscles were found and there was scar tissue along the trachea and the strap muscles were elevated off of the left thyroid, the thyroid gland was then found.  Then, using bipolar cautery and a Coblation dissector, the thyroid gland inferiorly was dissected off and the parathyroid gland was left inferiorly and there was scar tissue that was released and laterally, the thyroid gland was released, then came into the Berry ligaments.  The Berry ligament was dissected off and the gland came off all the way to the superior and inferior thyroid vessels, which were crossed with the Harmonic scalpel and removed.  No bleeding was seen.  There was a small nick in the external jugular vein that was tied with a 4-0 Vicryl suture ligature.  After this was completed, on examining the specimen, there appeared to be a lobule on it and it was sent off as possibly parathyroid, therefore it was reimplanted in the left lower sternocleidomastoid region using the silk suture ligature.  After this was completed, no bleeding was seen.  The laryngeal nerve could be seen and intact and then Rubber band  drain was placed throughout the neck along the thyroid bed and 4-0 Vicryl was used to close the strap muscles in an interrupted fashion along with the platysma region and subcutaneous region and a running 5-0 nylon was used to close the skin and Mastisol and Steri-Strips were placed along the skin edges and then on awakening, both laryngeal nerves were working normally.  Procedure was then terminated at that time.",Surgery
4548,"REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:  ,Suspicious calcifications upper outer quadrant, left breast.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 78-year-old woman who had undergone routine screening mammography on 06/04/08.  That study disclosed the presence of punctate calcifications that were felt to be in a cluster distribution in the left breast mound at the 2 o'clock position.  Additional imaging studies confirmed the suspicious nature of these calcifications.  The patient underwent a stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast 2 o'clock position on 06/17/08.  The final histologic diagnosis of the tissue removed during that procedure revealed focal fibrosis.  No calcifications could be identified in examination of the biopsy material including radiograph taken of the preserved tissue.,Two days post stereotactic core needle biopsy, however, the patient returned to the breast center with severe swelling and pain and mass in the left breast.  She underwent sonographic evaluation and was found to have a development of false aneurysm formation at the site of stereotactic core needle biopsy.  I was called to see the patient in the emergency consultation in the breast center.  At the same time, Dr. Y was consulted in Interventional Radiology.  Dr. Z and Dr. Y were able to identify the neck of the false aneurysm in the left breast mound and this was injected with ultrasound guidance with thrombin material.  This resulted in immediate occlusion of the false aneurysm.  The patient was seen in my office for followup appointment on 06/24/08.  At that time, the patient continued to have signs of a large hematoma and extensive ecchymosis, which resulted from the stereotactic core needle biopsy.  There was, however, no evidence of reforming of the false aneurysm.  There was no evidence of any pulsatile mass in the left breast mound or on the left chest wall.,I discussed the issues with the patient and her husband.  The underlying problem is that the suspicious calcifications, which had been identified on mammography had not been adequately sampled with the stereotactic core needle biopsy; therefore, the histologic diagnosis is not explanatory of the imaging findings.  For this reason, the patient was advised to have an excisional biopsy of this area with guidewire localization.  Since the breast mound was significantly disturbed from the stereotactic core needle biopsy, the decision was to postpone any surgical intervention for at least three to four months.  The patient now returns to undergo the excision of the left breast tissue with preoperative guidewire localization to identify the location of suspicious calcifications.,The patient has a history of prior stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast, which was performed on 01/27/04.  This revealed benign histologic findings.  The family history is positive involving a daughter who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40.  Other than her age, the patient has no other risk factors for development of breast cancer.  She is not receiving any hormone replacement therapy.

The patient states she has had inability to bear significant weight and had swelling, popping, and giving away, failing conservative treatment and underwent an operative procedure.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the Operative Suite at ABCD General Hospital on 09/08/03, placed on the operative table in supine position.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the right lower extremity was placed in a Johnson knee holder.  Care was ensured that all bony prominences were well padded and she was positioned and secured.  After adequately positioned, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Attention was then directed to creation of the arthroscopic portals, both medial and lateral portal were made for arthroscope and instrumentation respectively.  The arthroscope was advanced through the inferolateral portal taking in a suprapatellar pouch.  All compartments were then examined in sequential order with photodocumentation of each compartment.  The patella was noted to have grade-II changes of the inferior surface, otherwise appeared to track within the trochlear groove.  There was mild grooving of the trochlear cartilage.  The medial gutter was visualized.  There was no evidence of loose body.  The medial compartment was then entered.  There was noted to be a large defect on the medial femoral condyle grade III-IV chondromalacia changes with exposed bone in evidence of osteochondral displaced fragment.  There was also noted to be a degenerative meniscal tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus.  The arthroscopic probe was then introduced and the meniscus and chondral surfaces were probed throughout its entirety and photos were taken.  At this point, a meniscal shaver was then introduced and the chondral surfaces were debrided as well as any loose bodies removed.  This gave a smooth shoulder to the chondral lesion.  After this, the meniscus was debrided until it had been smooth over the frayed edges.  At this point, the shaver was removed.  The meniscal binder was then introduced and the meniscus was further debrided until the tear was adequately contained at this point.  The shaver was reintroduced and all particles were again removed and the meniscus was smoothed over the edge.  The probe was then reintroduced and the shaver removed, the meniscus was probed ___________ and now found to be stable.  At this point, attention was directed to the rest of the knee.  The ACL was examined.  It was intact and stable.  The lateral compartment was then entered.  There was noted to be a grade II-III changes of the lateral femoral condyle.  Again, with the edge of some friability at the shoulder of this cartilage lesion.  There was noted to be some mild degenerative fraying of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus.  The probe was introduced and the remaining meniscus appeared stable.  This was then removed and the stapler was introduced.  A chondroplasty and meniscoplasty were then performed until adequately debrided and smoothed over.  The lateral gutter was then visualized.  There was no evidence of loose bodies.  Attention was then redirected back to the medial and femoral condyles.,At this point, a 0.62 K-wire was then placed in through the initial portal, medial portal, as well as an additional poke hole, so we can gain access and proper orientation to the medial femoral lesion.  Microfacial technique was then used to introduce the K-wire into the subchondral bone in multiple areas until we had evidence of some bleeding to allow ___________ of this lesion.  After this was performed, the shaver was then reintroduced and the loose bodies and loose fragments were further debrided.  At this point, the shaver was then moved to the suprapatellar pouch and the patellar chondroplasty was then performed until adequately debrided.  Again, all compartments were then re-visualized and there was no further evidence of other pathology or loose bodies.  The knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  All instrumentation was removed.  Approximately 20 cc of 0.25% plain Marcaine was injected into the portal site and the remaining portion intraarticular.  Sterile dressings of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were then applied.  The patient was then transferred back to the gurney in supine position.,DISPOSITION:  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.  The patient was transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition.",Orthopedic

The patient was in the operating room in the prone position with the back prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The patient was given sedation and monitored.  Lidocaine 1.5% for skin wheal was made 10 cm from the midline to the bilateral L2 distal vertebral body.  A 20-gauge, 15 cm SMK needle was then directed using AP and fluoroscopic guidance so that the tip of the needle was noted to be along the distal one-third and anterior border on the lateral view and on the AP view the tip of the needle was inside the lateral third of the border of the vertebral body.  At this time a negative motor stimulation was obtained.  Injection of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plus 10 mg of Depo-Medrol was performed. Coagulation was then carried out for 90oC for 90 seconds.  At the conclusion of this, the needle under fluoroscopic guidance was withdrawn approximately 5 mm where again a negative motor stimulation was obtained and the sequence of injection and coagulation was repeated.  This was repeated one more time with a 5 mm withdrawal and coagulation.,At that time, attention was directed to the L3 body where the needle was placed to the upper one-third/distal two-thirds junction and the sequence of injection, coagulation, and negative motor stimulation with needle withdrawal one time of a 5 mm distance was repeated.  There were no compilations from this.  The patient was discharged to operating room recovery in stable condition.",Radiology

Open medial plication as well of the right knee.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,TOURNIQUET TIME:,  130 minutes at 325 mmHg.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , There was noted to be a grade-II chondromalacia patellofemoral joint.  The patella was noted to be situated laterally past the lateral femoral condyle.  There was a tear to the posterior horn of the medial meniscus within the white zone.  There was a complex tear involving a horizontal cleavage component to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus as well in the entire meniscus.  There was a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament.  The posterior cruciate ligament appeared intact.  Preoperatively, she had a positive Lachman with a positive pivot shift test as well as increased patellofemoral instability.,HISTORY: , This is a 39-year-old female who has sustained a twisting injury to her knee while on trampoline in late August.  She was diagnosed per MRI.  An MRI confirmed the clinical diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament tear.  She states she has had multiple episodes of instability to the patellofemoral joint throughout the years with multiple dislocations.  She elected to proceed with surgery to repair the anterior cruciate ligament as well as possibly plicate the medial retinaculum to help prevent further dislocations of the patellofemoral joint.  All risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with her at length.  She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE:  ,On 09/11/03, she was taken to the operating room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesiology Department.  Tourniquet was placed on the proximal thigh and it was then placed in a knee holder.  She was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  Longitudinal incision was made just medial to the tibial tubercle.  The subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The tendons of gracilis and semitendinosus were identified and isolated, and then stripped off the musculotendinous junction.  They were taken on the back table.  The soft tissue debris was removed from the tendons.  The ends of the tendons were sewn together using #5 Tycron whip type sutures.  The tendons were measured on back table and found to be 8 mm as the most adequate size, they were then placed under tension on the back table.  Stab incision was made in the inferolateral parapatellar region, through this camera was placed in the knee.  The knee was inflated with saline solution and operative pictures were obtained.  The above findings were noted.  A second port site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  Through this, a probe was placed.  Tear in the posterior horn medial meniscus was identified.  It was resected using a meniscal resector.  It was then further contoured using arthroscopic shaver.  Attention was then taken to the lateral compartment.  A partial meniscectomy was performed using the resector and the shaver.  The posterior periphery of the lateral meniscus was also noticed to be unstable.  A repair was then performed using two fasting fixed meniscal repair sutures to help anchor the meniscus around the popliteus tendon.  There was noted to be excellent fixation.  The shaver was then taken into the intrachondral notch.  First a partial chondroplasty was performed on the patella to remove the loose articular debris as well as a partial synovectomy to the medial aspect of the patellar femoral joint.  Next, the remnant of the anterior cruciate ligament was removed using the arthroscopic shaver and arthroplasty was then performed on the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle.  Next, a tibial guide was placed through the anterior medial portal.  A ___ pin was then placed up through the anterior incision entering the tibial eminence just anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament.  This tibial tunnel was then drilled using 8 mm cannulated drill.  Next, an over-the-top guide was then placed at approximately the 11:30 position.  A ____ pin was then placed into the femur and 8 mm drill was then used to drill this femoral tunnel approximately 35 mm.  Next the U shape guide was placed through tibial tunnel into the femur.  A pin was then placed through the distal femur from lateral to medial, through the U-shaped guide a puller wire was then passed through the distal femur.  It was then pulled out through the tibial tunnel using the You-shaped guide.  The tendon was then placed around the wire.  The wire was pulled back up through the tibial into the femoral tunnel.  A 40 mm bioabsorbable pin was then placed through the femoral tunnel securing the hamstring tendons.  Attention was then pulled through the tibial tunnel.  The knee was cycled approximately 20 times.  A 9 mm bioabsorbable screw was then placed through the tibial tunnel fixating the distal aspect of the graft.  There was noted definite fixation of the graft.  There was no evidence of impingement either in full flexion or full extension.  The knee was copiously irrigated and it was then suctioned dry.  A longitudinal incision was made just medial to the patellofemoral joint.  Soft tissues were carefully dissected and the medial retinaculum was incised along with the incision.  Following this, a release of lateral retinaculum was performed using a knife to further release the patellofemoral joint and allow further medial plication.  The medial retinaculum was then plicated using #1 Ethibond sutures and then oversewn with #0 Vicryl suture.  The subcuticular tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures followed by a #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch.  She was placed in a DonJoy knee immobilizer.  The tourniquet was deflated.  It was noted the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill.  She was transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded.  She will be full weightbearing on the lower extremity using the knee immobilizer locked in extension.  She may remove her dressing two to three days, however, follow back in the office in 10 to 14 days for suture removal.  She will require one to two more physical therapy to help regain motion and strength to the lower extremity.",Surgery

Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2, regular rate, frequent ectopic beats, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, preserved aortic component of the second heart sound.  There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard.  There is no rub or gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities without significant clubbing, cyanosis, and there is trivial to 1+ peripheral edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  Affect is appropriate.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA: , Pertinent labs include chest x-ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob.  No clear pulmonary vascular congestion.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7, it was 3.1 on admission, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 150, magnesium was 2 on 07/13/06.  Troponin was 0.03 followed by 0.18.  INR is 0.93, white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 36, platelet count 115,000.,EKGs are reviewed.  Initial EKG done on 08/19/08 at 1832 shows MAT, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, no ischemic changes.  She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.,IMPRESSION:  ,She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist.",Consult - History and Phy.
1168,"BLEPHAROPLASTY,The patient was prepped and draped.  The upper lid skin was marked out in a lazy S fashion, and the redundant skin marked out with a Green forceps.  Then the upper lids were injected with 2% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine and 1 mL of Wydase per 20 mL of solution.,The upper lid skin was then excised within the markings.  Gentle pressure was placed on the upper eyelids, and the fat in each of the compartments was teased out using a scissor and cotton applicator; and then the fat was cross clamped, cut, and the clamp cauterized.  This was done in the all compartments of the middle and medial compartments of the upper eyelid, and then the skin sutured with interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures.  The first suture was placed in the lower eyelid skin picking up the periorbital muscle and then the upper portion of the tarsus and then the upper lid skin.  This created a significant crisp, supratarsal fold.  The upper lid skin was closed in this fashion, and then attention was turned to the lower lid.,An incision was made under the lash line and slightly onto the lateral canthus.  The #15 blade was used to delineate the plane in the lateral portion of the incision, and then using a scissor the skin was cut at the marking.  Then the skin muscle flap was elevated with sharp dissection.  The fat was located and using a scissor the three eyelid compartments were opened.  Fat was teased out, cross clamped, the fat removed, and then the clamp cauterized.  Once this was done the skin was tailored to the lower lid incision site with mouth open and eyes in upward gaze, and then the excess skin removed.  The suture line was sutured with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures.  Once this was done the procedure was finished.,The patient left the OR in satisfactory condition.  The patient was given 50 mg of Demerol IM with 25 mg of Phenergan.",Surgery

He is brought to the operating room for transurethral resection of that bladder tumor.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , After preoperative counseling of the patient and his wife, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthetic.  He was placed in lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Using the visual obturator, the resectoscope was then inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The bladder was inspected confirming previous cystoscopic findings of a 2.5- to 3-cm left lateral wall bladder tumor away from the ureteral orifice.  Using the resectoscope loop, the tumor was then resected down to its base in a stepwise fashion.  Following completion of resection down to the base, the bladder was _______ free of tumor specimen.  The resectoscope was then reinserted and the base of the bladder tumor was then resected to get the base of the bladder tumor specimen, this was sent as a separate pathological specimen.  Hemostasis was assured with electrocautery.  The base of the tumor was then fulgurated again and into the periphery out in the normal mucosa surrounding the base of the bladder tumor.  Following completion of the fulguration, there was good hemostasis.  The remainder of the bladder was without evidence of significant abnormality.  Both ureteral orifices were visualized and noted to drain freely of clear urine.  The bladder was filled and the resectoscope was removed.  A 22-French 3-way Foley catheter was inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The balloon was inflated to 30 mL.

She has had atrial fibrillation and previous episodes of congestive heart failure.  She has dyspnea on exertion and occasionally orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.,PROCEDURE:,  After the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the above-mentioned procedure were explained to the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained, both verbally and in writing.  The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab where the procedure was performed.  The right inguinal area was thoroughly cleansed with Betadine solution and the patient was draped in the usual manner.  1% lidocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right inguinal area.  Once adequate anesthesia had been attained, a thing wall Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral vein.  A guidewire was advanced into the lumen of the vein without resistance.  The needle was removed and the guidewire was secured to the sterile field.  The needle was flushed and then used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  A guidewire was advanced through the lumen of the needle without resistance.  A small nick was made in the skin and the needle was removed.  This pressure was held.  A #6 French arterial sheath was advanced over the guidewire without resistance.  The dilator and guidewire were removed.  FiO2 sample was obtained and the sheath was flushed.  An #8 French sheath was advanced over the guidewire into the femoral vein after which the dilator and guidewire were removed and the sheath was flushed.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced through the venous sheath into a pulmonary capillary was positioned and the balloon was temporarily deflated.  An angulated pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricle under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to a manifold and flushed.  Left ventricular pressures were continuously measured and the balloon was re-inflated and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was remeasured.  Using dual transducers together and the mitral valve radius was estimated.  The balloon was deflated and mixed venous sample was obtained.  Hemodynamics were measured.  The catheter was pulled back in to the pulmonary artery right ventricle and right atrium.  The right atrial sample was obtained and was negative for shunt.  The Swan-Ganz catheter was then removed and a left ventriculogram was performed in the RAO projection with a single power injection of non-ionic contrast material.  Pullback was then performed which revealed a minimal LV-AO gradient.  Since the patient had aortic insufficiency on her echocardiogram, an aortogram was performed in the LAO projection with a single power injection of non-ionic contrast material.  The pigtail catheter was then removed and a Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the left main coronary artery was carefully engaged.  Using multiple hand injections of non-ionic contrast material, the left coronary system was evaluated in different views.  This catheter was then removed and a Judkins right #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the right coronary artery was then engaged and using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material, the right coronary system was evaluated in different views.  This catheter was removed.  The sheaths were flushed final time.  The patient was taken to the Postcatheterization Holding Area in stable condition.,FINDINGS:,HEMODYNAMICS: , Right atrial pressure 9 mmHg, right ventricular pressure is 53/14 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure 62/33 mmHg with a mean of 46 mmHg.

Uterine fibroids.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual manner for a laparoscopic procedure.  A speculum was placed into the vagina.  A single tooth tenaculum was utilized to grasp the anterior lip of the uterine cervix.  The uterus was sounded to 10.5 cm.  A #10 RUMI cannula was utilized and attached for uterine manipulation.  The single-tooth tenaculum and speculum were removed from the vagina.  At this time, the infraumbilical area was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine and infraumbilical vertical skin incision was made through which a Veress needle was inserted into the abdominal cavity.  Aspiration was negative; therefore the abdomen was insufflated with carbon dioxide.  After adequate insufflation, Veress needle was removed and an 11-mm separator trocar was introduced through the infraumbilical incision into the abdominal cavity.  Through the trocar sheath, the laparoscope was inserted and adequate visualization of the pelvic structures was noted.  At this time, the suprapubic area was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine.  A 5-mm skin incision was made and a 5-mm trocar was introduced into the abdominal cavity for instrumentation.  Evaluation of the pelvis revealed the uterus to be slightly enlarged and irregular.  The fallopian tubes have been previously interrupted surgically.  The ovaries appeared normal bilaterally.  The cul-de-sac was clean without evidence of endometriosis, scarring or adhesions.  The ureters were noted to be deep in the pelvis.  At this time, the right cornu was grasped and the right fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected without difficulty.  The remainder of the uterine vessels and anterior and posterior leaves of the broad ligament, as well as the cardinal ligament was coagulated and transected in a serial fashion down to level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  A similar procedure was carried out on the left with the left uterine cornu identified.  The left fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The remainder of the cardinal ligament, uterine vessels, anterior, and posterior sheaths of the broad ligament were coagulated and transected in a serial manner to the level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament was then dissected to the midline bilaterally, establishing a bladder flap with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.  At this time, attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The laparoscope was removed and attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The RUMI cannula was removed and the anterior and posterior leafs of the cervix were grasped with Lahey tenaculum.  A circumferential injection with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was made at the cervicovaginal portio.  A circumferential incision was then made at the cervicovaginal portio.  The anterior and posterior colpotomies were accomplished with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection without difficulty.  The right uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The left uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The parametrial tissue was then clamped bilaterally, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture bilaterally.  The uterus was then removed and passed off the operative field.  Laparotomy pack was placed into the pelvis.  The pedicles were evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted; therefore, the laparotomy pack was removed.  The uterosacral ligaments were suture fixated into the vaginal cuff angles with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The vaginal cuff was then closed in a running fashion with #0 Vicryl suture.  Hemostasis was noted throughout.  At this time, the laparoscope was reinserted into the abdomen.  The abdomen was reinsufflated.  Evaluation revealed no further bleeding.  Irrigation with sterile water was performed and again no bleeding was noted.  The suprapubic trocar sheath was then removed under laparoscopic visualization.  The laparoscope was removed.  The carbon dioxide was allowed to escape from the abdomen and the infraumbilical trocar sheath was then removed.  The skin incisions were closed with #4-0 Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  Neosporin and Band-Aid were applied for dressing and the patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Estimated blood loss was approximately 100 mL.  There were no complications.  The instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct.",Surgery

We did complete an oral mechanism examination and clinical swallow evaluation, which showed her swallowing to be within functional limits.  The patient improved on her turn taking skills during conversation, and she was able to listen to a narrative and recall the main idea plus five details after a three-minute delay independently.  The patient continues to have difficulty with visual scanning in cancellation task, secondary to her significant left neglect.  She also did not accomplish her sustained attention goal, which required her to complete tasks greater than 80% accuracy for at least 15 minutes independently.

We are consulted at this time to discuss further treatment options.,ABCD and his wife state that his history goes back to approximately 2-2-1/2 weeks ago when he developed some left-sided flank pain.  Initially, he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened.  Eventually this prompted him to present to the emergency room.  A CT scan was done there, and he was found to have a large left adrenal mass worrisome for metastatic disease.  At that point, he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for further evaluation.  On admission on 12/19/08, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for full staging purposes.  The CT scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region, extending into the precarinal region, the subcarinal region, and the right hilum.  This was causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the SVC and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery.  There was an abnormal lymph node noted in the AP window and left hilar region.  There was another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm.  There was also an 8 mm non-calcified nodule noted in the posterior-inferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease.  There were areas of atelectasis particularly in the right base.  There was also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing.  There was a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax.  In the abdomen, there was a mass involved in the left adrenal gland as well as a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor.  All other structures appeared normal.  On 12/22/08, a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass was performed.  Pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  At this point, we have been consulted to discuss further treatment options.,On further review, ABCD states that he has may be had a 20 pound weight loss over the last couple of months which he relates to anorexia or decreased appetite.

There is no evidence of cerebral metastasis, hemorrhage, or acute infarction.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history, who now presents with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  At this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable.  His wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis.  They preferred not to know the exact average as to how long someone lives with this disease.  I did offer chemotherapy as a way to treat this disease.  Chemotherapy has been associated both with palliation of symptoms as well as prolong survival.  At this point, he has an excellent functional status and I think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite well.,In terms of chemotherapy, I talked briefly about the side affects including but not limited to GI upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, loss of appetite, low blood counts including the possible need for transfusion as well as the risk of infections, which in some rare cases can be fatal.  I would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine.  This would be both medications given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8.  This cycle will be repeated after 1-week break so that the cycle lasts 21 days.  The goal will be to complete 6 cycles of this as long as he is responding and tolerating the medication.,In terms of staging Mr. ABCD'S had all the appropriate staging.  A PET-CT scan could be done, but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the CT scans that we have.,At this point, his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain.  He will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control.  As this is the holiday weekend, I do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them, but I did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on Monday.  At that point, we will get him in and I will also begin working on making arrangements for his chemotherapy.,Thank you very much for this interesting consult.",Consult - History and Phy.

The plan is for repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position, and sterilely prepped and draped.  A superior curvilinear scrotal incision was then made in the left hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery into the subcutaneous tissue.  We then used the curved cryoclamp to dissect into the scrotal space and found the tunica vaginalis and dissected this up to the external ring.  We were able to dissect all the way up to the ring, but were unable to get the testis delivered.  We then made a left inguinal incision with a 15-blade knife, further extending with electrocautery through Scarpa fascia down to the external oblique fascia.  The testis again was not visualized in the external ring, so we brought the sac up from the scrotum into the inguinal incision and then incised the external oblique fascia with a 15-blade knife further extending with Metzenbaum scissors.  The testis itself was quite high up in the upper canal.  We then dissected the gubernacular structures off of the testis, and also, then opened the sac, and dissected the sac off and found that he had a communicating hernia hydrocele and dissected the sac off with curved and straight mosquitos and a straight Joseph scissors.  Once this was dissected off and up towards the internal ring, it was twisted upon itself and suture ligated with an 0 Vicryl suture.  We then dissected the lateral spermatic fascia, and then, using blunt dissection, dissected in the retroperitoneal space to get more cord length.  We also dissected the sac from the peritoneal reflection up into the abdomen once it had been tied off.  We then found that we had an adequate amount of cord length to get the testis in the mid-to-low scrotum.  The patient was found to have a type III epididymal attachment with a long looping vas, and we brought the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation and tacked it to mid-to-low scrotum with a 4-0 chromic stay stitch.  The upper aspect of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic pursestring suture.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  We then placed the local anesthetic, and the ilioinguinal nerve block, and placed a small amount in both incisional areas as well.  We then closed the external oblique fascia with a running suture of 0-Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and cord structures were not bottom closure.  The Scarpa fascia was closed with a 4-0 chromic suture, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on the both incisions, and IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was in a stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.",Surgery

It is overall a Class-II indication for permanent pacemaker insertion.,PROCEDURE:,  The risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure were all discussed with the patient and the patient's family in detail at great length.  Overall options and precautions of the pacemaker and indications were all discussed.  They agreed to the pacemaker.  The consent was signed and placed in the chart.  The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab, where she was monitored throughout the whole procedure.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner for permanent pacemaker insertion.  Myself and Dr. Wildes spoke for approximately 8 minutes before insertion for the procedure.  Using a lidocaine with epinephrine, the area of the left subclavian vein and left pectodeltoid region was anesthetized locally.,IV sedation, increments, and analgesics were given.  Using a #18 gauge needle, the left subclavian vein access was cannulated without difficulty.  A guidewire was then passed through the Cook needle and the Cook needle was then removed.  The wire was secured in place with the hemostat.  Using a #10 and #15 scalpel blade, a 5 cm horizontal incision was made in the left pectoral deltoid region where the skin was dissected and blunted down into the pectoris major muscle fascia.  The skin was then undermined used to make a pocket for the pacemaker.  The guidewire was then tunneled through the pacer pocket.  Cordis sheath was then inserted through the guidewire.  The guidewire and dilator were removed.  ___ cordis sheath was in placed within.  This was used for insertion of the ventricular screw and steroid diluted leads where under fluoroscopy.  It was placed into the apex.  Cordis sheath was then split apart and removed and after the ventricular lead was placed in its appropriate position and good thresholds were obtained, the lead was then sutured in place with #1-0 silk suture to the pectoris major muscle.

Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Deep venous thrombosis.,6.  Recurrence of the cancer.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Epidural anesthesia was administered by the anesthesiologist in the holding area.  Preoperative antibiotic was also given in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was then taken into the operating room after which general LMA anesthesia was administered.  The patient was shaved and then prepped using Betadine solution.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder with clear urine drain.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed.  The rectus fascia was opened sharply.  The perivesical space and the retropubic space were developed bluntly.  Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  Bilateral obturator pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed.  The obturator nerve was identified and was untouched.  The margin for the resection of the lymph node bilaterally were the Cooper's ligament, the medial edge of the external iliac artery, the bifurcation of the common iliac vein, the obturator nerve, and the bladder.  Both hemostasis and lymphostasis was achieved by using silk ties and Hemo clips.  The lymph nodes were palpably normal and were set for permanent section.  The Bookwalter retractor was then repositioned and the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally using Metzenbaum scissors.  The puboprostatic ligament was taken down sharply.  The superficial dorsal vein complex over the prostate was bunched up by using the Allis clamp and then tied by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was then bunched up by using the Allis over the membranous urethral area.  The dorsal vein complex was ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture on a CT-1 needle.  The Allis clamp was removed and the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra was then identified and was dissected out.  The urethral opening was made just distal to the apex of the prostate by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This was extended circumferentially until the Foley catheter could be seen clearly.  2-0 Monocryl sutures were then placed on the urethral stump evenly spaced out for the anastomosis to be performed later.  The Foley catheter was removed and the posteriormost aspect of urethra and rectourethralis muscle was transected.  The lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally to sweep the neurovascular bundles laterally on both sides.  The plane between Denonvilliers' fascia and the perirectal fat was developed sharply.  No tension was placed on the neurovascular bundle at any point in time.  The prostate dissected off the rectal wall easily.  Once the seminal vesicles were identified, the fascia covering over them were opened transversely.  The seminal vesicles were dissected out and the small bleeding vessels leading to them were clipped by using medium clips and then transected.  The bladder neck was then dissected out carefully to spare most of the bladder neck muscles.  Once all of the prostate had been dissected off the bladder neck circumferentially the mucosa lining the bladder neck was transected releasing the entire specimen.  The specimen was inspected and appeared to be completely intact.  It was sent for permanent section.  The bladder neck mucosa was then everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Inspection at the prostatic bed revealed no bleeding vessels.  The sutures, which were placed previously onto the urethral stump, were then placed onto the bladder neck.  Once the posterior sutures had been placed, the Foley was placed into the urethra and into the bladder neck.  A 20-French Foley Catheter was used.  The anterior sutures were then placed.  The Foley was then inflated.  The bed was straightened and the sutures were tied down sequentially from anteriorly to posteriorly.  Mild traction of the Foley catheter was placed to assure the anastomosis was tight.  Two #19-French Blake drains were placed in the perivesical spaces.  These were anchored to the skin by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The instrument counts, lab counts, and sponge counts were verified to be correct, the patient was closed.  The fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture.  Skin was approximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.",Urology

The patient subsequently went to the operating room on 07/25/2003 for a right hip hemiarthroplasty per the Orthopedics Department.  Subsequently, the patient was doing well postoperatively, however, the patient does have severe O2 and steroid-dependent COPD and at an extreme risk for any procedure.  The patient began developing abdominal pain over the course of the next several days and a consultation was requested on 08/07/2003 for surgical evaluation for upper abdominal pain.  During the evaluation, the patient was found to have an acute acalculous cholecystitis in which nonoperative management was opted for and on 08/08/03, the patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement to drain the gallbladder.  The patient did well postdrainage.  The patient's laboratory values and biliary values returned to normal and the patient was planned for a removal of the tube with 48 hours of the tubing clamp.  However, once the tube was removed, the patient re-obstructed with recurrent symptoms and a second tube was needed to be placed; this was done on 08/16/2003.  A HIDA scan had been performed, which showed no cystic duct obstruction.  A tube cholecystogram was performed, which showed no cystic or common duct obstruction.  There was abnormal appearance of the gallbladder, however, the pathway was patent.  Thus after failure of two nonoperative management therapies, extensive discussions were made with the family and the patient's only option was to undergo a cholecystectomy.  Initial thoughts were to do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, however, with the patient's severe COPD and risk for ventilator management, the options were an epidural and an open cholecystectomy under local was made and to be performed.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient's gallbladder had some patchy and necrosis areas.  There were particular changes on the serosal surface as well as on the mucosal surface with multiple clots within the gallbladder.  The patient also had no plane between the gallbladder and the liver bed.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and discussed with the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating room after an epidural was performed per anesthesia.  Local anesthesia was given with 1% lidocaine.  A paramedian incision was made approximately 5 cm in length with a #15 blade scalpel.  Next, hemostasis was obtained using electro Bovie cautery.  Dissection was carried down transrectus in the midline to the posterior rectus fascia, which was grasped with hemostats and entered with a #10 blade scalpel.  Next, Metzenbaum scissors were used to extend the incision and the abdomen was entered .  The gallbladder was immediately visualized and brought up into view, grasped with two ring clamps elevating the biliary tree into view.  Dissection with a ______ was made to identify the cystic artery and cystic duct, which were both easily identified.  The cystic artery was clipped, two distal and one proximal to the gallbladder cutting between with Metzenbaum scissors.  The cystic duct was identified.  A silk tie #3-0 silk was placed one distal and one proximal with #3-0 silk and then cutting in between with a Metzenbaum scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed from the liver bed using electro Bovie cautery.  A plane was created.  The hemostasis was obtained using the electro Bovie cautery as well as some Surgicel.  The gallbladder was then removed as specimen, sent to pathology for frozen sections for diagnosis, of which the hemorrhagic cholecystitis was diagnosed on frozen sections.  Permanent sections are still pending.  The remainder of the fossa was hemostatic with the Surgicel and attention was next made to closing the abdomen.  The peritoneum as well as posterior rectus fascia was approximated with a running #0 Vicryl suture and then the anterior rectus fascia was closed in interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin staples were used on the skin and sterile dressings were applied and the patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition.",Surgery

There was a grade II to III chondral changes to the patellar groove.  The patella was noted to be displaced laterally riding on the edge of the lateral femoral condyle.  The medial lateral meniscus showed small amounts of degeneration, but no frank tears were seen.  The articular surfaces and the remainder of the knee appeared intact.  Cruciate ligaments also appeared intact to direct stress testing.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 36-year-old Caucasian female with a long-standing history of right knee pain.  She has been diagnosed in the past with chondromalacia patella.  She has failed conservative therapy.  It was discussed with her the possibility of a arthroscopy lateral release and a tubercle transfer (anterior medialization of the tibial tubercle) to release stress from her femoral patellofemoral joint.  She elected to proceed with the surgical intervention.  All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her.  She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE: , On 09/04/03, she was taken to Operating Room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table with the general anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department.  Her leg was placed in a Johnson knee holder and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A stab incision was made in inferolateral and parapatellar regions.  Through this the cannula was placed and the knee was inflated with saline solution.  Intraoperative pictures were obtained.  The above findings were noted.  Second portal site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  Through this, a arthroscopic shaver was placed and the chondroplasty in the patella was performed and removed the loose articular debris.  Next, the camera was placed through the inferomedial portal.  An arthroscopic Bovie was placed through the inferolateral portal.  A release of lateral retinaculum was then performed using the Bovie.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  Next, the knee was suctioned dry.  An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  An oblique incision was made along the medial parapatellar region of the knee.  The subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected and the hemostasis was again controlled with electrocautery.  The retinaculum was then incised in line with the incision.  The patellar tendon was identified.  The lateral and medial border of the tibial tubercle were cleared of all soft tissue debris.  Next, an osteotome was then used to cut the tibial tubercle to 45 degree angle leaving the base of the bone incision intact.  The tubercle was then pushed anteriorly and medially decreasing her Q-angle and anteriorizing the tibial tubercle.  It was then held in place with a Steinmann pin.  Following this, a two 4.5 mm cannulated screws, partially threaded, were drilled in place using standard technique to help fixate the tibial tubercle.  There was excellent fixation noted.  The Q-angle was noted to be decreased to approximately 15 degrees.  She was transferred approximately 1 cm in length.  The wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The medial retinaculum was then plicated causing further medialization of the patella.  The retinaculum was reapproximated using #0 Vicryl.  Subcuticular tissue were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed with #4-0 Vicryl running PDS suture.  Sterile dressing was applied to the lower extremities.  She was placed in a Donjoy knee immobilizer locked in extension.  It was noted that the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill following deflation of the tourniquet.  She was transferred to recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.,Prognosis of this patient is poor secondary to the advanced degenerative changes to the patellofemoral joint.  She will remain in the immobilizer approximately six weeks allowing the tubercle to reapproximate itself to the proximal tibia.",Surgery
